#Quest_0.Your first night
gtnh.quest0.name=Your first night
gtnh.quest0.desc=Your first task will be to find food, and a shelter for the night. The nights will be cruel, as this pack has hardcore darkness. It probably would be a good idea to collect some food now...

#Quest_1.Where is the flint?
gtnh.quest1.name=Where is the flint?
gtnh.quest1.desc=As you might have noticed, while collecting gravel, no flint dropped for you. Well, there is a... recipe for that. Look up flint in NEI and craft some!

#Quest_2.Sticks 'n Stones
gtnh.quest2.name=Sticks 'n Stones
gtnh.quest2.desc=This book has a built-in reading light, lucky you! Most probably you will read this text while you are waiting for the night to be over. Once it is, go out and collect some gravel and wood. Keep in mind that you need food, so look for Pam's Harvestcraft gardens. (And save some of the vegetables for seeds!)

#Quest_3.Storage for days
gtnh.quest3.name=Storage for days
gtnh.quest3.desc=Now that you've unlocked 3x3 crafting, it's about time to make some storage for your goods. Take some of your wood, and craft a chest. You will need 4 wood, 4 planks and 1 flint.

#Quest_4.Crafting time
gtnh.quest4.name=Crafting time
gtnh.quest4.desc=It's time to get yourself a 3x3 crafting area. Grab some flint and some wood, and build one!

#Quest_5.Tools
gtnh.quest5.name=Tools
gtnh.quest5.desc=Now that you've got a shelter, crafting table, and a place to store your items, you should make some tools. (Unless you'd like to continue punching trees with your bare hand...)

#Quest_6.You reap...
gtnh.quest6.name=You reap...
gtnh.quest6.desc=You won't always get food rewards from this book, so it might be a good idea to take care of that problem. As you've created a hoe already, go and find some water nearby and make a field. Let's trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.

#Quest_7....what you sow
gtnh.quest7.name=...what you sow
gtnh.quest7.desc=If you, by chance, did read the previous quest and planted the carrot I gave you, then you're fine. Meanwhile, you should turn some more fruits and vegetables into seeds, and increase the size of your farm to get a steady supply of food.

#Quest_8.Get that stone
gtnh.quest8.name=Get that stone
gtnh.quest8.desc=Look at you, with your shiny flint pickaxe! Time to mine some cobblestone. Yay! (And maybe you can improve this dirt-hut too...)

#Quest_9.Fire, fire, Grandpa!
gtnh.quest9.name=Fire, fire, Grandpa!
gtnh.quest9.desc=Time to burn some stuff, isn't it? You can't make charcoal in it, but you sure will find some usage for it soon(tm).

#Quest_10.Rest in pieces
gtnh.quest10.name=Rest in pieces
gtnh.quest10.desc=It's GLOPPing time! Go kill some pigs to gather meat. (And yes, they will drop cooked porkchops. Now isn't that useful...)

#Quest_11.Sharpness: Over... 5...
gtnh.quest11.name=Sharpness: Over... 5...
gtnh.quest11.desc=It's about time to craft something more useful: A sword!

#Quest_12.Fluffy and red
gtnh.quest12.name=Fluffy and red
gtnh.quest12.desc=Epic quest: Kill some sheep! (And try to get some wool, for a bed, obviously...)

#Quest_13.SO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
gtnh.quest13.name=SO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
gtnh.quest13.desc=Sleepy time, and the end of Tier 0. Congratulations, you've built your first hideout, and you should have a steady supply of food by now. See you again in tier 1!

#Quest_14.What is that...?
gtnh.quest14.name=What is that...?
gtnh.quest14.desc=You've seen a lot of trees, but there are a few that look really special. You are sure that these trees are much more than just wood to build your home with or used to get charcoal.

#Quest_15.Ready, set, go!
gtnh.quest15.name=Ready, set, go!
gtnh.quest15.desc=You probably should have a home by now. A steady supply of food is a fundamental requirement at all times. Take this journal to keep track of the things you've eaten. You will have to travel far in this tier, better be prepared!

#Quest_16.Better Tank... Iron Tank
gtnh.quest16.name=Better Tank... Iron Tank
gtnh.quest16.desc=Storing more than 16 buckets of fluid in one tank? Sure! Just make an iron tank or upgrade the Buildcraft tank.\nDiamond tanks carry up to 64 buckets and obsidian ones are blast proof.

#Quest_17.Sand: The Gathering
gtnh.quest17.name=Sand: The Gathering
gtnh.quest17.desc=In a strange vision you saw a big structure which would allow you to make charcoal. Finally some torches! According to your calculations, you will need a lot of sand for that.

#Quest_18.Basic processing
gtnh.quest18.name=Basic processing
gtnh.quest18.desc=Most things are unavailable at the moment, so let's begin with something simple. Take some of your cobblestone and smelt it into regular stone. Since this modpack is evil, you'll need to use wood for that. How much fun is that?!

#Quest_19.Maceration v0.1 Alpha
gtnh.quest19.name=Maceration v0.1 Alpha
gtnh.quest19.desc=This fancy little device works (almost...) like a macerator. Some people say it's even better, since it does not require power, yay! You only need to craft one for this quest, but you probably should make some more if you can...

#Quest_20.Gravel: The Gathering
gtnh.quest20.name=Gravel: The Gathering
gtnh.quest20.desc=Your tools will eventually lose durability. You think it would be a good idea to collect more gravel in order to provide yourself with flint for more tools.

#Quest_21.Clay: The Gathering
gtnh.quest21.name=Clay: The Gathering
gtnh.quest21.desc=While bored, you thought that it might be a good idea to take up pottery. You should go and find some clay, the riverbanks should have some.

#Quest_22.Finite water!?
gtnh.quest22.name=Finite water!?
gtnh.quest22.desc=Finite water is a problem, that's for sure. Last night, you had an idea. If you can drink cacti, you should also be able make water out of 8 cacti and use that for most recipes that require water. How cool is that? So what about another trade? 10 wood for.. 3 cacti so you can setup a farm. Deal?

#Quest_23.Something to carry liquids
gtnh.quest23.name=Something to carry liquids
gtnh.quest23.desc=You tried to move water with your bare hands, which didn't work at all. Luckily, you remember how to make a bucket out of clay.

#Quest_24.Getting (char)coal
gtnh.quest24.name=Getting (char)coal
gtnh.quest24.desc=It's time to get yourself some charcoal. For that, we're going to build a coke oven. Good that you just collected a lot of resources! (What a coincidence...)

#Quest_25.Another brick in the wall
gtnh.quest25.name=Another brick in the wall
gtnh.quest25.desc=Your vision becomes more clear, you'll need bricks for your first multiblock structure. You think that 104 bricks should be enough. However, the bricks you'll need are somewhat special. Make sure to craft the correct ones!

#Quest_26.Forming press v0.1
gtnh.quest26.name=Forming press v0.1
gtnh.quest26.desc=As you may have noticed, you cannot turn clay into bricks directly. Well, to be fair, it wasn't a good recipe anyway. You'll probably end up with something bread-shaped. So in order to make bricks, you need a form. Get yourself a knife and a blank pattern, and cut a brick sized piece out. It's as easy as that.

#Quest_27.Finally, some power
gtnh.quest27.name=Finally, some power
gtnh.quest27.desc=Now that you have a coke oven, you should start producing charcoal. The more, the better. Don't worry about the creosote oil; I have another deal for you...

#Quest_28.Copper sky, Iron curtain
gtnh.quest28.name=Copper sky, Iron curtain
gtnh.quest28.desc=With your newly acquired fuel source, you are now ready to process more advanced materials than stone or clay; Iron or copper, for example. Just in case you don't know, they spawn in rather large veins. Use the following quests to locate the most important veins.

#Quest_29.Another fuel source
gtnh.quest29.name=Another fuel source
gtnh.quest29.desc=Lignite and regular coal are the fuel sources you'll definitely need. The latter can be turned into coal coke, which is a superior fuel source to smelt your first large batch of ore.

#Quest_30.Copper
gtnh.quest30.name=Copper
gtnh.quest30.desc=Copper ingots can be created by smelting copper, chalcopyrite, or malachite ore.

#Quest_31.Tin
gtnh.quest31.name=Tin
gtnh.quest31.desc=Tin ingots can be created by smelting tin and cassiterite ore.

#Quest_32.Book parts
gtnh.quest32.name=Book parts
gtnh.quest32.desc=After you found a way to move water around, you had another brilliant idea: Paper! Paper is no longer made with sugarcane, you will now need wood pulp. You will need a lot of wood to craft wood pulp, so better grab your axe and go chop some trees.

#Quest_33.Tinker-time
gtnh.quest33.name=Tinker-time
gtnh.quest33.desc=While using your flint tools is fun in terms of burning pigs and cows, they are not very good, and can't be repaired. You discovered how to craft tools that could be repaired and upgraded, but for that you definitely need a more advanced crafting technique.

#Quest_34.Aluminini...um...?
gtnh.quest34.name=Aluminini...um...?
gtnh.quest34.desc=However it is spelled, you will need it. You can find it in chunks of gravel on the surface. Try searching in rivers. (This quest is optional, but recommended.)

#Quest_35.Making bronze
gtnh.quest35.name=Making bronze
gtnh.quest35.desc=Now that you've found copper and tin, you should make yourself some bronze. Use your macer... mortar to grind up some copper and tin ingots, and mix them together!

#Quest_36.Important tools
gtnh.quest36.name=Important tools
gtnh.quest36.desc=In order to craft even basic machines, you'll need new tools. Most of them can be replaced by machines later. For now, you should become familiar with each of their recipes, as you will need a lot of these tools, starting today.\n\nYour new tools can also be used to make Railcraft water tanks, a very useful multiblock considering the finite water feature.

#Quest_37.Getting iron
gtnh.quest37.name=Getting iron
gtnh.quest37.desc=Iron can be found in multiple veins. Magnetite veins (y 30-180), chalcopyrite veins (y 5-60), and limonite veins (y 10-40) all contain iron ore.

#Quest_38.Making better tools
gtnh.quest38.name=Making better tools
gtnh.quest38.desc=With aluminium and copper, you can create a pretty durable material "Aluminum Brass", which can be used to cast better tools. These can be used to mine some more advanced ores.\n\nBut first you need a smeltery. See the Multiblock Goals chapter in this book, or find smeltery blocks in a village nearby.

#Quest_39.Better storage
gtnh.quest39.name=Better storage
gtnh.quest39.desc=While standard chests are good for your basic items and goods, they are not ideal for storing a large amount of ore. You should build yourself some barrels in order to keep things organized.

#Quest_40.You shall proceed
gtnh.quest40.name=You shall proceed
gtnh.quest40.desc=As you've gathered and crafted all materials and tools you need for your basic steam machinery, you may now proceed to the next tier. Keep in mind that you'll need mountains of resources in order to craft even the simplest things, so you probably should stock up on all ores in this tier. But that's up to you.

#Quest_41.Don't burn your fingers!
gtnh.quest41.name=Don't burn your fingers!
gtnh.quest41.desc=You have decided it's time to make some tasty pizza, but your fingers got burned badly. Reading an ancient cookbook you discovered a pair of magical items that would allow you to carry anything hot, even lava in a bucket.\n\nThe gloves have to be placed in the Baubles ring slots of Thaumcraft.

#Quest_42.Cow Tipper
gtnh.quest42.name=Cow Tipper
gtnh.quest42.desc=Before you had to kill some pigs and sheep to complete quests. Now it's time to kill some cows and hopefully get some leather. If you are lucky and get a cow trophy you may never need to kill another cow in the future.

#Quest_43.Cotton, cotton and more cotton
gtnh.quest43.name=Cotton, cotton and more cotton
gtnh.quest43.desc=You find out that cotton is very useful, it can be used to make string, wool, and some other useful items too. Make a small cotton plantation to get tons of it.

#Quest_44.Welcome to Tier 1
gtnh.quest44.name=Welcome to Tier 1
gtnh.quest44.desc=Welcome, and well done so far! This tier is all about your first machines, getting more stuff from your ores and making bronze ingots in a more efficient manner.

#Quest_45.Multiblock tanks... Railcraft tanks
gtnh.quest45.name=Multiblock tanks... Railcraft tanks
gtnh.quest45.desc=576 buckets of fluid, that should be enough to store all the creosote you have accumulated thus far. If that isn't enough you can make this tank bigger. The smallest tanks are 3x3x4 while the biggest are 9x9x8.\n\nHint: Fluid will auto-output (without any pumps) if you place a valve on the bottom side of the tank.\n\nUse only Buckets to move fluids because cells get destroyed.

#Quest_46.More advanced alloys
gtnh.quest46.name=More advanced alloys
gtnh.quest46.desc=Your smeltery does a great job mixing metals into alloys, but it's not very efficient, and limited in its complexity. You need something new, so why not put your steam to some use? It might also come in handy when processing raw rubber.

#Quest_47.Upgrade: High speed alloys
gtnh.quest47.name=Upgrade: High speed alloys
gtnh.quest47.desc=Like most machines, there is a more advanced version of the alloy smelter. Keep in mind that this machine uses a lot of steam, so you better get some more boilers first. (This quest is optional)

#Quest_48.A very important alloy
gtnh.quest48.name=A very important alloy
gtnh.quest48.desc=The most important alloy (until you reach a higher tier) is undoubtedly red alloy. Fortunately, you have an alloy smelter, so grab some redstone and combine it with copper to get yourself a handful of that.

#Quest_49.The hell is that?
gtnh.quest49.name=The hell is that?
gtnh.quest49.desc=In order to get more machines, you'll need pistons. But not those amateurish ones, you need special ones, and I shall guide you in the making of them.

#Quest_50.Macerator v1.0!
gtnh.quest50.name=Macerator v1.0!
gtnh.quest50.desc=Finally you are able to make a device that will replace your mortar. However, the "no-durability" feature of this device comes with a cost: You need 2 diamonds for the grinding heads.

#Quest_51.Extracting stuff
gtnh.quest51.name=Extracting stuff
gtnh.quest51.desc=As you'll need rubber later to make cables from wires, you should get yourself a steam extractor. You can also use this machine to get more dyes from flowers, or process different fruits into juice.

#Quest_52.A clear view
gtnh.quest52.name=A clear view
gtnh.quest52.desc=Are you still living in your dirt/cobblestone bunker? How about letting in some sunlight? Grind up some sand and flint and craft some glass dust. Put it in your smeltery and pour it into a casting basin to make clear glass.\n\nHint: In order to use it for recipes, you have to chisel it.

#Quest_53.Hammer time v2
gtnh.quest53.name=Hammer time v2
gtnh.quest53.desc=Using 6 ingots to craft a hammer seems pretty wasteful, as this tool has durability. How nice would it be to have a machine that does the same but without having durability and using three ingots to make two plates? Guess what, there is one! And you should totally get one.

#Quest_54.Compressing stuff
gtnh.quest54.name=Compressing stuff
gtnh.quest54.desc=This rather simple device does a very important job: compression. It's main function is to press 9 ingots into a block, but it's also useful for a variety of recipes, for example making firm tofu.

#Quest_55.Upgrade: A better compressor
gtnh.quest55.name=Upgrade: A better compressor
gtnh.quest55.desc=An updated version of the steam compressor. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

#Quest_56.Upgrade: Forge hammer
gtnh.quest56.name=Upgrade: Forge hammer
gtnh.quest56.desc=An updated version of the steam forge hammer. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

#Quest_57.Upgrade: Extractor
gtnh.quest57.name=Upgrade: Extractor
gtnh.quest57.desc=An updated version of the steam extractor. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. You most probably want to craft this, as the extractor does also extract your nerves... (This quest is optional)

#Quest_58.Upgrade: Better macerator
gtnh.quest58.name=Upgrade: Better macerator
gtnh.quest58.desc=An updated version of the steam macerator. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

#Quest_59.Steam alternatives
gtnh.quest59.name=Steam alternatives
gtnh.quest59.desc=There is more than one way to get steam for your machines. This completely optional quest shows you some alternative methods for producing steam.

#Quest_60.Upgrade: Coal boiler
gtnh.quest60.name=Upgrade: Coal boiler
gtnh.quest60.desc=This is basically just an upgrade to your current coal boiler, however it produces more than twice as much steam. Something you should consider building if you're planning to get some of the upgraded machines.

#Quest_61.Another use for Java, I mean Lava
gtnh.quest61.name=Another use for Java, I mean Lava
gtnh.quest61.desc=With a more durable steel casing, you can use lava to make steam.

#Quest_62.The power of the sun
gtnh.quest62.name=The power of the sun
gtnh.quest62.desc=The sun has quite a bit of power, so why not use it to produce steam? \n\nHint: Just remember that the solar boiler calcifies and becomes less efficient over time.

#Quest_63.Using steam to cook things
gtnh.quest63.name=Using steam to cook things
gtnh.quest63.desc=A rather slow process, but it's more efficient than using a regular furnace.

#Quest_64.Upgrade: Better furnace
gtnh.quest64.name=Upgrade: Better furnace
gtnh.quest64.desc=An updated version of the steam furnace. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

#Quest_65.Blastoff!
gtnh.quest65.name=Blastoff!
gtnh.quest65.desc=It's about time to make some steel. Look in the Multiblock Goals quest set and build a bricked blast furnace. Return here when you made at least 8 steel ingots.

#Quest_66.Time for some logic
gtnh.quest66.name=Time for some logic
gtnh.quest66.desc=Good news! You are now able to advance to the next tier! Bad news is: You still have to craft a lot of things before you can begin. Fear not mortal, I shall guide you!

#Quest_67.Wired, weird?!
gtnh.quest67.name=Wired, weird?!
gtnh.quest67.desc=One of the very basic materials which you should memorize how to craft are wires and cables. Basically you just cut a plate into a wire with your wire cutter. Not very efficient, but there will be a better way later.

#Quest_68.Your first logic circuit
gtnh.quest68.name=Your first logic circuit
gtnh.quest68.desc=Steam machines are quite stupid, they just do one thing over and over again. As you advance into the electrical age, you've decided that you want the machines to have more features, like automatic output in order to create some automation. For that, you need logic circuits.

#Quest_69.Wire-Wrap
gtnh.quest69.name=Wire-Wrap
gtnh.quest69.desc=Placing wires without insulation seems to be a bad idea. Now that you have an extractor to extract raw rubber out of sticky resin and an alloy smelter to further process it using sulphur, you should work on getting some insulating rubber sheets.

#Quest_70.Steam-a-licious!
gtnh.quest70.name=Steam-a-licious!
gtnh.quest70.desc=You almost made it. One last crafting step is required in order to advance to Tier 2. Keep going!

#Quest_71.Basic crafting: Motors
gtnh.quest71.name=Basic crafting: Motors
gtnh.quest71.desc=Motors are little devices that can turn electrical power into rotational energy. Very useful for all kind of machines, and not that difficult to craft. The pattern is always the same, only the materials change with tiers. For now you can use restone to magnetize your iron rod. Later one you are able to build a Electromagnetic Polarizer.

#Quest_72.Basic crafting: Rotors
gtnh.quest72.name=Basic crafting: Rotors
gtnh.quest72.desc=Rotors are also crafted using an identical pattern with different materials. A bit annoying to craft at the moment, but you don't need a lot of them anyway.

#Quest_73.Basic crafting: Casings
gtnh.quest73.name=Basic crafting: Casings
gtnh.quest73.desc=All machines need a hull to keep their private parts together. Good news is: They are crafted in the same way for every tier, only the materials change.

#Quest_74.You are not prepared!!!
gtnh.quest74.name=You are not prepared!!!
gtnh.quest74.desc=It's time for something really big: A smeltery! There's a lot to craft, so better gather some resources...

#Quest_75.The water dilemma
gtnh.quest75.name=The water dilemma
gtnh.quest75.desc=Finite water is a problem. But fear not, there are solutions! I shall guide you to a steady supply of water.

#Quest_76.Time to get some steel
gtnh.quest76.name=Time to get some steel
gtnh.quest76.desc=You need steel? Uhh... fine. Let's get busy...\n\nHint: The bricked blast furnace can share walls with other ones, just like most GT multi blocks. How will this affect the air quality though...

#Quest_77.EBF-Time
gtnh.quest77.name=EBF-Time
gtnh.quest77.desc=In order to get alumin(i)um ingots, you need an electric blast furnace. It's another very important step towards victory, so let's get started.\n\nGetting the heating coils might be a little tricky...\n\n(You need 2 LV hatches with 4A of 32V total, or 3 LV hatches with MOOOORE power if the multiblock is not fully repaired)\n\nA few recipes produce CO2/SO2 as fluid. You need to add an additional fluid hatch to the top layer of the EBF to collect it otherwise it gets auto voided. It depends on the muffler hatch how much fluid you can recover. Max muffler recovers = 78%.

#Quest_78.Upgrade #1: More heat
gtnh.quest78.name=Upgrade #1: More heat
gtnh.quest78.desc=Better materials need higher temperatures. You can just exchange the old coils with the new ones. You can even recycle the old coils, how fancy is that!

#Quest_79.Upgrade #2: Higher tier
gtnh.quest79.name=Upgrade #2: Higher tier
gtnh.quest79.desc=To reach the 3600k heat capacity of your EBF, so you can process high-tier materials like tungsten, you need nichrome heating coils.

#Quest_80.Compress all the things
gtnh.quest80.name=Compress all the things
gtnh.quest80.desc=Martin's (DreamMasterXXL) favourite machine. Compress ALL the things! With explosives, of course.

#Quest_81.At the end of...
gtnh.quest81.name=At the end of...
gtnh.quest81.desc=...the universe everything freezes eventually. But waiting for the heat death of the universe might take too long. Therefore we present you the vacuum freezer. It should be good enough to cool your hot stuff. You will need a minimum of 16 frost proof machine casings, the rest depends on your setup.

#Quest_82.An unexpected Bonus
gtnh.quest82.name=An unexpected Bonus
gtnh.quest82.desc=Because we're nice developers, we decided to add a little bonus if you happen to compress charcoal. Not only does it allow you to process more than 16 steel at a time (not in the bricked blast furnace), it also yields 10 times the burn time of a piece of charcoal. So one charcoal for free. This bonus only occurs on the first compression step. (But for fanciness, you should definitely get a quintuple one!)

#Quest_83.High speed charcoal
gtnh.quest83.name=High speed charcoal
gtnh.quest83.desc=Sure, those coke ovens are nice, but they aren't even remotely fast enough to keep up with a large steam boiler. Luckily, there is an upgrade available! The creosote oil will not be produced, but the process will speed up dramatically. Who needs that nasty yellowish flammable stuff anyway...

#Quest_84.Where I can put all the liquids?
gtnh.quest84.name=Where I can put all the liquids?
gtnh.quest84.desc=With your brand new alloy smelter you are able to combine two materials. What happens if you mix some obsidian dust and glass? Obsidian glass, great. Your first tank that you can make would be a Buildcraft tank. This tank can carry up 16 buckets of a single fluid. It's possible to upgrade those tanks so they can hold up to 64 buckets.

#Quest_85.Smelt all the things stack wise...
gtnh.quest85.name=Smelt all the things stack wise...
gtnh.quest85.desc=...with this great invention! Uses power to smelt up to 2 stacks of items at once! Can't go any faster! \n\nHint: Parallel smelting depends on coils, consult your local doctor before use.

#Quest_86.Upgrade #3: Upgrade tier 4
gtnh.quest86.name=Upgrade #3: Upgrade tier 4
gtnh.quest86.desc=To process more advanced materials like enderium, enriched naquadah or niobium-titanium you need more than 3600K. Time to upgrade your EBF... again.

#Quest_87.Steel multiblock tanks
gtnh.quest87.name=Steel multiblock tanks
gtnh.quest87.desc=Do you want to have tanks that can hold double the amount than that of the iron ones? Go ahead and make a steel tank. All sizes allowed from 3x3x4 to 9x9x8 blocks. \n\nHint: Fluid will auto-output (without any pumps) if you place a valve on the bottom side of the tank.\n\nOnly use buckets because cells get destroyed.

#Quest_88.Welcome to Tier 2
gtnh.quest88.name=Welcome to Tier 2
gtnh.quest88.desc=Why, hello there! Seems you've made it into the electrical age. Don't be so quick to throw away your steam machines, you'll probably want to use them until you reach tier 3.

#Quest_89.Tier 3
gtnh.quest89.name=Tier 3
gtnh.quest89.desc=In tier 3, you will be able to craft your first actually "useful" machines. Basic ones do the job, but with MV, a lot more recipes will unlock. Your goal here is to set up stable ore processing for the vast amounts of materials you'll need later on. You also should focus on power production if you haven't already done that.

#Quest_90.Damn you, wire cutter!
gtnh.quest90.name=Damn you, wire cutter!
gtnh.quest90.desc=Enough is enough. No more wasting gazillions of ingots just for a couple of wires. Now that you have power, you should go for a wiremill!

#Quest_91.You're gonna hate this #1
gtnh.quest91.name=You're gonna hate this #1
gtnh.quest91.desc=The first item you'll need a lot of. If you want to pull items out of chests or barrels you'll need one. \n\nHint: Goes pretty well with item pipes or GT machines, adjust with a screwdriver.

#Quest_92.You're gonna hate this #4
gtnh.quest92.name=You're gonna hate this #4
gtnh.quest92.desc=The fourth item you'll need a lot of, and is also a pain to craft. Arguably the most painful item ever. \n\nHint: Works like a conveyor but can work with selected item slots, adjust with a screwdriver.

#Quest_93.You're gonna hate this #2
gtnh.quest93.name=You're gonna hate this #2
gtnh.quest93.desc=The second item you'll need a lot of. When you want to get fluid out of tanks you'll need one. \n\nHint: Goes pretty well with fluid pipes or GT machines, adjust with a screwdriver. It can also be further upgraded into a fluid regulator that allows precise control of fluid transfer speed.

#Quest_94.Electric macerator
gtnh.quest94.name=Electric macerator
gtnh.quest94.desc=It is highly recommended to get one of these, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to macerate something is a lot better when using EU.

#Quest_95.You're gonna hate this #3
gtnh.quest95.name=You're gonna hate this #3
gtnh.quest95.desc=A piston, but more .. "electrical". The third item you are going to craft a lot of in the future.

gtnh.quest101.name=Mjolnir!!! (electric forge hammer)
gtnh.quest101.desc=Not really required, but it is a lot faster than the steam one and it can be automated. If you feel like ore washing is too slow use this hammer. There are no recipes that require anything more than steam level to hammer something.

#Quest_102.Cutting things apart
gtnh.quest102.name=Cutting things apart
gtnh.quest102.desc=An absolutely mandatory machine to have. It will cut rods into bolts, plates into casings, logs into planks, and all of that will be done with the highest possible efficiency. Totally worth it! \n\nHint: Just add water.

#Quest_103.Get ready for Tier 3
gtnh.quest103.name=Get ready for Tier 3
gtnh.quest103.desc=In order to proceed forward, you need to get aluminium. A lot of it. But for now, one is enough to unlock this quest.

gtnh.quest127.name=Project red begging
gtnh.quest127.desc=First of all there are 3 types of pipes: null logic, pressurized and routed.\n-Null Logic are the most basic kind. They can't have any logical thinking. Item transport pipes are of this category and they are used to craft and connect the routed and pressurized pipes. It would be a wise choice to craft some extras.\n \n-Routed pipes are the most advanced. They can communicate with each other in order to create pipe networks, and can be used for very complex tasks.\n \n-Pressurized pipes are too complicated to use and explain. You won't need them anyway since you can use the routed ones to do anything you want.\n\nHowever, in order to control the logic of the routed pipes you will need special circuit chips.

#Quest_128.Ender not-so-IO
gtnh.quest128.name=Ender not-so-IO

gtnh.quest226.name=See the unseen
gtnh.quest226.desc=Everything is made of 6 primal aspects. Those aspects can be combined to form compound aspects, but in the end, there are only 6. Like the infused shards you found. You noticed that those shards start to vibrate when you bring them next to something that is made of the respective aspect. Maybe you can create a device to actually "scan" items, and reveal their compounds? This could be very useful later on.

#Quest_227.Tables to work on
gtnh.quest227.name=Tables to work on
gtnh.quest227.desc=Indeed, the idea with the bookshelf did work. Now you need a nice table to do some research on, and probably something to infuse items with vis while crafting. Maybe you should try to smite a table with your wand.

#Quest_228.Bloody water

#Quest_230.Your first wand
gtnh.quest230.name=Your first wand
gtnh.quest230.desc=You are sure that this place will give you all the answers you are looking for! To continue, you need something to handle the magic energy called "vis". Guess it's time to craft your first wand.

gtnh.quest231.name=Tome of knowledge
gtnh.quest231.desc=All the things you've discovered so far, you need to write them down. But you are lazy, and you have a wand, so why not try a magical way to "write down" your research? You wonder if you could enchant a book with your wand, so that it will keep track of your progress... You should try that on a bookshelf!

#Quest_232.Improving your wand
gtnh.quest232.name=Improving your wand
gtnh.quest232.desc=Your wand does a great job in storing and releasing vis as you please. However, those iron caps are... Weak. If you don't pay enough attention to it, it might hurt the node. Maybe you should try to improve it with caps made out of a more valuable material. Like.. gold, perhaps?

#Quest_233.Getting shards
gtnh.quest233.name=Getting shards
gtnh.quest233.desc=Now that you found all six primal types of infused stone, you need to break those up in order to get the shards. The easiest way to do that, is to throw these stones in your Forge Hammer.

gtnh.quest234.desc=While doing all your research and mining of these infused stones, you had an idea how to actually use the wood of a Greatwood tree to make a new wand.

#Quest_235.Better screws
gtnh.quest235.name=Better screws
gtnh.quest235.desc=Unfortunately, your aluminium screws don't work with the greatwood rod. Somehow, the wood seems to repel the material. Luckily, you already have a blast furnace, so you can get a better material than aluminium.

#Quest_236.A more powerful "scale"
gtnh.quest236.name=A more powerful "scale"
gtnh.quest236.desc=The naga scales are weak, they can only hold a very limited amount of vis. You need a better, more powerful component to store vis in your wand. You've heard rumors about an evil wizard in the Twilight Forest. Maybe he has... something... that can be used?

#Quest_237."Stores 50 vis" wand
gtnh.quest237.name="Stores 50 vis" wand
gtnh.quest237.desc=Now combine your new wand, and be more powerful than before! You have a feeling, that this new wand will come in handy very soon(tm).

#Quest_238.Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
gtnh.quest238.name=Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
gtnh.quest238.desc=Your arcane table does a great job with infusing primal vis into items while crafting. However, you feel that there must be more. What if you could infuse items with all kinds of magic aspects? The possibilities are endless...

#Quest_239.Yet another brick in the wall...
gtnh.quest239.name=Yet another brick in the wall...
gtnh.quest239.desc=A magical one this time. You are on your way to infusion, and you need 8 of those in total.

gtnh.quest241.name=Not for soup
gtnh.quest241.desc=At least not for edible soup, but for essentia slurry. Get yourself a Cauldron and give it a solid whack with your wand. Place the netherrack under the crucible and set it on fire with the flint and steel. Now you need to fill it with water (works with pipes too = auto refill)

gtnh.quest242.name=Balanced shards sdrahs decnalaB

#Quest_245.The choice...
gtnh.quest245.name=The choice...
gtnh.quest245.desc=By now, you should've collected a few (or a lot) of locations for aura nodes to get vis from. You  might also have noticed, that you probably are low on a certain aspect, like ordo or ignis. Well, good news. In exchange for some crystal clusters, I will give you one of my old nodes.

gtnh.quest252.name=This is the end...
gtnh.quest252.desc=...of your apprenticeship. You have mastered all 6 primal aspects, you mastered the weak and strong infusion of essentia and vis, and you've already made your adept wand. But be warned, young one. The further you progress, the more darkness, and evil will tempt you to follow the forbidden ways of magic. I have seen things... weather changing, random teleportation, or even a Wither spawning right next to someone. Be careful, my friend...

#Quest_253.Turning liquids into essentia
gtnh.quest253.name=Turning liquids into essentia
gtnh.quest253.desc=What a simple idea. So many people wasted tons of buckets just to get aqua from water, or sano from milk. Why didn't they just dissolve the liquid itself? Stupid ones...

#Quest_254.Essentia filtering
gtnh.quest254.name=Essentia filtering
gtnh.quest254.desc=This nifty little device will filter out essentia. Once it has received a single unit of any type, it will only accept this type until it is completely empty. How convenient. You can place more than one on top of an alchemical furnace.

gtnh.quest255.desc=And lava! It's an excellent magical heat source.

#Quest_256.Not coal
gtnh.quest256.name=Not coal
gtnh.quest256.desc=Way better. To be fair, it's a waste to use coal itself, but it also works with charcoal and lignite dust. And it speeds up the dissolving of items in an alchemical furnace.

gtnh.quest257.name=Save the squids, we must

gtnh.quest263.name=It doesn't work
gtnh.quest263.desc=I tried to combine the lich bones I had with this new wand rod. The result: A pile of ashes. It crumbled to dust within seconds. I need a better conductor.

gtnh.quest264.name=Obsidian rod

#Quest_265.Creating a better wand
gtnh.quest265.name=Creating a better wand
gtnh.quest265.desc=This greatwood wand is nice, but it can only store 50 vis. Not enough to move nodes. My tries to use silverwood failed, but I've come across other mundane materials that I could use to make a new wand core.

#Quest_266.More durable screws
gtnh.quest266.name=More durable screws
gtnh.quest266.desc=Those stainless steel screws don't work on these rods. Due to the huge amounts of vis those wands can carry, the screws somehow "melt" away. I need a more durable material. I guess I will try titanium next.

#Quest_275.Centi-vis
gtnh.quest275.name=Centi-vis
gtnh.quest275.desc=Many advanced machines require vis in order to do what they're supposed to. But using a wand as some sort of battery to transfer vis from a node to your machine didn't work as expected. What if you could rip open a node?

#Quest_276.Bring it home
gtnh.quest276.name=Bring it home
gtnh.quest276.desc=You probably have a nice collection of bookmarked nodes. But running around to recharge your wand(s) isn't really the way an adept thaumaturge should get his required vis. Moving nodes is not that hard, but without doubt, you need something to protect them from each other.

gtnh.quest277.name=Automated wand-recharge
gtnh.quest277.desc=So you found a way to gather nodes now. What about automated wand recharge? Wouldn't that be extremely convenient?

gtnh.quest287.name=What could possibly go wrong?
gtnh.quest287.desc=256 essentia in one block! Now that is what I call storage. Does make weird sounds, but I guess it's nothing special...

#Quest_288.Let's try this
gtnh.quest288.name=Let's try this
gtnh.quest288.desc=Mortals. Pah. What do they know about REAL power. The voices tell me I need to focus on alienis and tenebrae if I want to advance. So what about food?

gtnh.quest307.desc=The pearl you've found has some interesting effects on you. Not only are the voices almost gone, somehow it has also expanded your perception. You can "feel" the magic around you. This is definitely worth some further investigation.

#Quest_308.The final goal
gtnh.quest308.name=The final goal
gtnh.quest308.desc=Thanks to your help I have managed to create the ultimate energy source: An encased wormhole that drains energy from a synthesized pocket universe, to the point when it reaches heat death. I have no use for it, so you may have it. Thank you for making my dream come true!

#Quest_309.Shards of opposite worlds
gtnh.quest309.name=Shards of opposite worlds
gtnh.quest309.desc=This morning, you just wanted to facepalm yourself to death. During your past journeys, you have already seen strangely colored shards. But unlike the primal shards you use every day, these seem to contain the raw essence of their dimension. Heaven and Hell... so to speak. Two opposite worlds.

gtnh.quest324.name=Unleashed the power
gtnh.quest324.desc=To make use of your tool to its full extent, you'll have to unleash its hidden power. This is not an easy task; But it's well worth the effort!

gtnh.quest325.name=Unleashed the power
gtnh.quest325.desc=To make use of your tool to its full extent, you'll have to unleash its hidden power. This is not an easy task; But it's well worth the effort!

gtnh.quest331.name=Why walk...
gtnh.quest331.desc=...when you can teleport? This little device allows you to teleport around almost for free. Is it cheaty? Is it OP? Nope, it's a celestial gateway!

#Quest_332.Brewers start
gtnh.quest332.name=Brewers start
gtnh.quest332.desc=In order to get started with your basic witchery needs, you need a witches oven. It's used to get the most basic ingredients for your recipes: Fumes.

#Quest_333.Offerings
gtnh.quest333.name=Offerings
gtnh.quest333.desc=For all your offering needs. And of course, it looks fancy!

#Quest_334.A cauldron?
gtnh.quest334.name=A cauldron?

#Quest_335.Don't touch the needle!
gtnh.quest335.name=Don't touch the needle!
gtnh.quest335.desc=While having not many recipes by itself, the few it has are rather important for your further witchery progression.

#Quest_336.Probably usable for soup
gtnh.quest336.name=Probably usable for soup
gtnh.quest336.desc=But its main purpose is to brew potions and infusions.

#Quest_337.Don't shake it too much
gtnh.quest337.name=Don't shake it too much
gtnh.quest337.desc=Unlike nitroglycerin, this stuff doesn't explode. But you still shouldn't shake it too much...

#Quest_338.Getting basic fumes
gtnh.quest338.name=Getting basic fumes
gtnh.quest338.desc=Fume extraction is an essential thing to do, and you'll need a lot of those on your journey.

#Quest_339.Circle magic
gtnh.quest339.name=Circle magic
gtnh.quest339.desc=For circle magic, you need... a circle, obviously. There are 4 types of chalk you can use, and you'll need all of them to proceed.

#Quest_340.Portable power source
gtnh.quest340.name=Portable power source
gtnh.quest340.desc=By infusing a stone with fiery magic you can create an "Attuned Stone". These stones can be used to link non-magical devices to the magical currents present...

#Quest_341.Flying OINKment
gtnh.quest341.name=Flying OINKment
gtnh.quest341.desc=You tried, it doesn't fly. And it also doesn't make any OINK sounds, sadly. But there might be some use for it...

#Quest_342.Nimbus 1999
gtnh.quest342.name=Nimbus 1999
gtnh.quest342.desc=Not as good as its successor, the 2000'ish model, but still "somehow" useful...

#Quest_343.Bloodlust: Refined evil
gtnh.quest343.name=Bloodlust: Refined evil
gtnh.quest343.desc=Refined good was out of stock, sorry.

#Quest_344.Bloodlust: Witches hand
gtnh.quest344.name=Bloodlust: Witches hand

gtnh.quest345.desc=Who needs an antidote?

#Quest_346.Bloodlust: Taglock kits
gtnh.quest346.name=Bloodlust: Taglock kits
gtnh.quest346.desc=Get a death protection poppet and get a stack of taglock kits. For all your trolling needs.

#Quest_347.Bloodlust: Drop of luck
gtnh.quest347.name=Bloodlust: Drop of luck
gtnh.quest347.desc=Hard to get, even with that quest. But less of a grind...

#Quest_348.Bloodlust: "Cain" sword
gtnh.quest348.name=Bloodlust: "Cain" sword
gtnh.quest348.desc=Serves 2 purposes: Style. And... ah, yeah... Something useful for vampires.

#Quest_349.Be a vampire; Like a sir
gtnh.quest349.name=Be a vampire; Like a sir
gtnh.quest349.desc=Sometimes it can be troublesome to get fancy clothing. However, if you prove yourself worthy, you get a set for free.

#Quest_350.A few more things...
gtnh.quest350.name=A few more things...
gtnh.quest350.desc=Ok, I think I have everything I need to assemble the device. Can you assist me with some additional materials? I need to update most of my machines, as these exotic components you got me damaged most of them already. Don't worry, I have a list here.\n\nMost of my circuits burned to a crisp while I was trying to measure the conductivity of these soul and life shards. I need better ones.\n\nGood lord, these mysterious crystals have eaten away my diamond grinding head! How could that happen? Can you get me a better one?\n\nDo you see that pile of chrome over there? No? Neither do I. Because the machine was VAPORIZED! Good that you gave me 2 singularities, the first one... Well... Just get me a better casing, would you?\n\nIt seems, that the stabilizers need... stabilizing... But I'm out of field generators. Can you help me with this?

#Quest_351.Hello there
gtnh.quest351.name=Hello there
gtnh.quest351.desc=I've observed your pathway, and I have to say, I'm impressed. I might need your help soon, on a big project of mine.

#Quest_352.Power. So much power!
gtnh.quest352.name=Power. So much power!
gtnh.quest352.desc=If only I could harness it... Well, hi there my friend. I need your help with a project of mine. I want to create an immense power source, but I have a few problems that I need to solve first. Will you help me? You will be rewarded.

#Quest_353.A problem that matters
gtnh.quest353.name=A problem that matters
gtnh.quest353.desc=I need to open a wormhole. But for that, I need an immense gravitational field. One like those created upon the death of a star. But I can't really "kill" a sun for this. I need to compress matter somehow... \nBut... How?

#Quest_354.Now that matters!
gtnh.quest354.name=Now that matters!
gtnh.quest354.desc=Of course! The matter condenser! How come I didn't think of that?

#Quest_355.I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest355.name=I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest355.desc=Opening the wormhole is one thing, but I need to stabilize it, so it doesn't harm anything. I guess I need something made of crystal. Why? Because I like it fancy. Find me a crystal-based, transparent material with immense power, would you?

#Quest_356.Shiny!
gtnh.quest356.name=Shiny!
gtnh.quest356.desc=What in the world is this? This is amazing! I need more of these! They will be an amazing containment material for the wormhole!

#Quest_357.I'm hungry
gtnh.quest357.name=I'm hungry
gtnh.quest357.desc=What... I work a lot! So get me some food please.

#Quest_358.It needs a power plug...
gtnh.quest358.name=It needs a power plug...
gtnh.quest358.desc=Given the fact that I will be able to craft this device, it needs some kind of "plug" to get the power out. I need something to conduct immense amounts of power. I thought about superconductors, but they don't fit with the crystal casing material I have in mind. I need 2 different crystals, one for positive and one for negative charge.

#Quest_359.Red and blue
gtnh.quest359.name=Red and blue
gtnh.quest359.desc=Really? A red and blue crystal? How awesome is that! I think I will need 8 of each color, just to be sure.

#Quest_360.A casing
gtnh.quest360.name=A casing
gtnh.quest360.desc=I need something for the outer shell. Again, a crystal-based material would be best, because I like it shiny. I tested all crystals we know and none of them meet the requirements. I heard you have access to the space? Can you try to find a suitable material while you're out there?

#Quest_361.Fancy!
gtnh.quest361.name=Fancy!
gtnh.quest361.desc=Yes. Yes! That's it! Bring me more of this stuff! I probably need a lot of it...

#Quest_362.Beyond imagination
gtnh.quest362.name=Beyond imagination
gtnh.quest362.desc=What is this? Draconium dust? I wonder if I could use this for something...

#Quest_363.The power of dragons
gtnh.quest363.name=The power of dragons
gtnh.quest363.desc=Hey my friend. I got your sample, and I have to say, I'm amazed. This material has a lot of potential, but it's useless at the moment. I have an idea how to turn this into something useful, but I need you to help me with a few problems first.\n\nI need a good handful of that stuff for my research. Please get me some.

#Quest_364.A hull
gtnh.quest364.name=A hull
gtnh.quest364.desc=First things first, we need a hull. I played around with your sample, and it seems that it reacts with every known material. It even attacks Iridium! It's completely harmless if it's in a box that is open, but as soon as I try to enclose it in something, poof. It breaks free. We need something stronger than iridium my friend.

#Quest_365.Dense, denser, Neutronium
gtnh.quest365.name=Dense, denser, Neutronium
gtnh.quest365.desc=Now look at this. This stuff is incredibly dense. Maybe this material will be sufficiently strong?\n\nThis looks promising. Send me some samples, and I will try my luck.

#Quest_366.Not a planet
gtnh.quest366.name=Not a planet
gtnh.quest366.desc=This place is interesting. Maybe I should try to find new materials here...

#Quest_367.Successful.. Or not?
gtnh.quest367.name=Successful.. Or not?
gtnh.quest367.desc=Heh, neutronium. I didn't even know such a thing really exists. Unfortunately, the draconium dust was enclosed for... 5 seconds? But, it was a small success. \n\nOk let's travel to some planets and moons and look for the new material. I think we have to fly very far away for it.

#Quest_368.Black Plutonium
gtnh.quest368.name=Black Plutonium
gtnh.quest368.desc=This doesn't seem to be dense, but it's a material you haven't seen before. Maybe this could be the solution?\n\nBlack what? Huh, interesting. Send me some samples, I want to analyse it.

#Quest_369.We have a hull
gtnh.quest369.name=We have a hull
gtnh.quest369.desc=Surprisingly, this material is able to contain the draconium dust. It could be the radiation. Good job my friend!

#Quest_370.Draconium Dust core
gtnh.quest370.name=Draconium Dust core
gtnh.quest370.desc=I've created a first sample of what I shall call "Draconium Dust core". Not quite the result I expected to be honest, but see for yourself.

#Quest_371.We need to control it
gtnh.quest371.name=We need to control it
gtnh.quest371.desc=The problem is, that the immense power of this dust is released all at once. We need something to control the vast amount of energies. I noticed that the dust starts to glow when it gets near an aura node. Maybe Thaumaturgy has the solution?

#Quest_372.The power of primals
gtnh.quest372.name=The power of primals
gtnh.quest372.desc=What else could control energies better than a focus of crystallized primal energy? With this little item, it should be possible to control the energies released from the dust.

#Quest_373.Unforeseen consequences
gtnh.quest373.name=Unforeseen consequences
gtnh.quest373.desc=You haven't heard anything in a while from the technician. You have a feeling that something might have gone terrible wrong, so you went to his place to investigate. What you found was... nothing. A void. It seems that he tried to combine the pearl with the dust. What did he say? The dust reacts to aura nodes? Of course it does. It amplifies the energies by a thousand times. And giving it raw primal energy, good lord, what has he done. May he rest in peace...

#Quest_374.I'm on my own now
gtnh.quest374.name=I'm on my own now
gtnh.quest374.desc=I need to continue my research. I still think that this primordial pearl is the key to control the dust, but I'm not sure how. Maybe the pearl is just too strong? I should try to use something that's similar, but less powerful. It reacts to vis, so maybe.. I should try to make a wand focus with that pearl. That way, I could channel vis into the dust without actually combining both.

#Quest_375.An interesting material
gtnh.quest375.name=An interesting material
gtnh.quest375.desc=This metal has quite interesting properties. It seems, that it has absorbed some of the energy that exists in the End. While ender pearls are quite fragile, this metal is a lot more durable. However, the absorbed energy is not enough to teleport things around. But you might find a solution for this.

#Quest_376.Gross, what is that...
gtnh.quest376.name=Gross, what is that...
gtnh.quest376.desc=It's purple, and it smells like rotten eggs. But while staring at this unpleasant fluid, you had an idea. You can't reach the dust directly, but can you actually teleport something in and out the field? Might be worth a try.

#Quest_377.An appropriate focus
gtnh.quest377.name=An appropriate focus
gtnh.quest377.desc=You've tried a lot, and nothing was quite enough to activate the dust. Until now. You finally found a focus that is able to transmit enough power to cause a heavy reaction with the dust, but not enough to cause problems.

#Quest_378.Activated draconium dust
gtnh.quest378.name=Activated draconium dust
gtnh.quest378.desc=At least for a short period of time. The wand focus is powerful enough to activate the dust, but it will convert back to regular dust as soon as I stop feeding it with vis. If I only could contain it, surround it with a forcefield...

#Quest_379.The strongest forcefield
gtnh.quest379.name=The strongest forcefield
gtnh.quest379.desc=In order to create a forcefield, I need to build myself a containment device. I will use only the best emitters I can afford. I will take no risks here.

#Quest_380.Not what I expected...
gtnh.quest380.name=Not what I expected...
gtnh.quest380.desc=The outcome was... interesting. It did not explode, instead, the activated draconium dust generated a counter-field to mine! Unfortunately, the emitters could not stand the reverse energies, and melted. I was able to shut it off quick enough to save the machine casing (At least what's left from it...) And a couple of field generators.

#Quest_381.Forcefield, second try
gtnh.quest381.name=Forcefield, second try
gtnh.quest381.desc=I came to the following conclusion: Draconium dust seems to react nicely with all kinds of magic energy, and seems to repel technology. So I need to find a way to create a forcefield with magic alone. There must be a way...

#Quest_382.A magic force field
gtnh.quest382.name=A magic force field
gtnh.quest382.desc=While node stabilizers are too weak, you found a way to generate a strong containment field, generated by magic itself. You tried to use warded glass, but even the "frozen in spacetime" material could not resist the power of activated draconium dust. You decided to build another device, this time with your newest invention.\n\nThe vortex attenuator is powerful enough to negate even hungry nodes, and it also will be able to contain activated draconium dust.\n\nJust to be sure, I will add some amplifiers to it.

#Quest_383.What the...?
gtnh.quest383.name=What the...?
gtnh.quest383.desc=The device works! It is able to fully contain and separate the draconium dust from everything around it! Unfortunately... It also prevents the vis from passing the barrier, which results in regular draconium dust... In a forcefield...

#Quest_384.Looking for alternatives
gtnh.quest384.name=Looking for alternatives
gtnh.quest384.desc=It is frustrating. Either you are able to contain the dust but can't activate it, or, you activate it and it causes serious damage. Maybe you need to find answers somewhere else.\n\nDraconic... Like... Dragon?

#Quest_385.Draconic... Like... Dragon?
gtnh.quest385.name=Draconic... Like... Dragon?
gtnh.quest385.desc=Maybe you where looking for the right things in the wrong place. As this dust obviously origins from dragons, the best thing to do now is to find answers in the dimension of dragons: The End.

#Quest_386.Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.name=Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.desc=These ghosts are weird beings. But, I found this ectoplasm, which, by itself, seems to be pretty useless.

#Quest_387.Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.name=Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.desc=By a random guess of yours, you combined molten ender pearls and a few more of these shards with an empty gem, and it turned blue. It is pulsating with power. You tried to use it on your containment device, and it seems to be able to bypass the force field, while keeping it intact that the same time. Sadly, it doesn't have enough power to let vis pass through. Maybe you can even further increase the gems power?

#Quest_388.Arcane shards
gtnh.quest388.name=Arcane shards
gtnh.quest388.desc=While the normal world is based on vis and primal energy, the End seems to be quite different. This arcane shard is the crystallized form of this energy, just like the primal shards that you used so many times in the past. By pure randomness, you discovered that it reacts with the metal you've found.

#Quest_389.Draconic evolution
gtnh.quest389.name=Draconic evolution
gtnh.quest389.desc=Don't you hate it to manually compress all those tiny piles? Let's automate this process! A combination of a typefilter, a chest buffer (super buffer in HV) and a packager frees you from that annoying task. The chestbuffer can hold up to 9 tiny piles and the super buffer can hold all your tiny dusts and you can set its mode with a screwdriver on the output side. Set it to 9 and let the packager handle the rest.

#Quest_390.Balanced thaumium
gtnh.quest390.name=Balanced thaumium
gtnh.quest390.desc=This new metal is quite cheap, and has an awesome conductivity towards all 6 primal aspects. Regarding the capsule, I'd say it is a superconductor for vis. I think I can finally assemble the final frame.

#Quest_391.Automated evolution
gtnh.quest391.name=Automated evolution
gtnh.quest391.desc=The machine is working pretty well, but it's tedious to fill in the reagents manually. But you have an idea, you could use a few basic components to fully automate the process.\n\nYou can use robot arms and conveyor belts to automate the input and output.\n\nObviously, you need to power the machines. A solar panel will do just fine.\n\nIn order to automate the catalyst, you need a few things. One golem will gather basic materials, while the second one will hunt creepers and ghasts for the more valuable ingredients.\n\nYou found a way to re-use the singularity, so you only need to get some sand. Luckily, the golem that works on the catalyst will be able to get glass too. He just needs a little additional motivation.\n\nYour golems need light, obviously. Also, it would be nice if there are some signal lamps that indicate the status of the process. Would it not?

#Quest_392.Activated teleport gem
gtnh.quest392.name=Activated teleport gem
gtnh.quest392.desc=You are sure that you've just discovered the solution for your containment problem. This gem happily transmits vis on request, while keeping the containment field intact. What a great day!

#Quest_393.You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.name=You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.desc=Now that you are able to contain the activated draconium dust for an infinite amount of time, you where able to assure the energy it releases. The readings are incredible. You have never seen such a power before. The only problem is, the machinery required to keep the dust in this state is too large to use it for crafting.\n\nYou noticed something that might help: The dust reacts to vis, but it needs a lot of it, therefore you require the animation focus. If you could find a catalyst, that you can mix the dust with, you could make the dust react with the vis from its surroundings instead of a direct beam.

#Quest_394.A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.name=A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.desc=That's it. This catalyst contains all primal energies in a quite different form, a lot weaker than any node. However, in combination with the draconium dust, it amplifies the vis that's around it, which leads to a permanent activation. It still needs to be contained, but you don't need the direct vis beam any more.\n\nThe result is a compound, which still emits massive amounts of power, but is less destructive. It still attacks the neutronium, but I think if I can find a capsule-like container that has special properties, I could create a portable version of it.

#Quest_395.Bulma would be proud
gtnh.quest395.name=Bulma would be proud
gtnh.quest395.desc=By combining a dimensional singularity with some glass cylinders and molten gold, I was able to create a miniature containment field within a very small area. Interesting enough, the new draconium blend amplifies the containment field from the inside. Once I fill the blend in the capsule, it immediately "seals" itself. I won't be able to remove or replace the dust any more, but I don't think I have to...\n\n\nThe perfect vessel for massive power!

#Quest_396.The final steps
gtnh.quest396.name=The final steps
gtnh.quest396.desc=Now that I've found a way to stabilize the draconium dust and keep it safe in a small capsule, I just need to make a small container for it, so I can drain the energy on demand. Neutronium will serve very well, but I need a magic conductor. Thaumium works, but gets way too hot and void metal has a bad conductivity. I need to find a magic alloy that is more "balanced" in terms of primal aspects

#Quest_397.Endless evolution
gtnh.quest397.name=Endless evolution
gtnh.quest397.desc=Using your machine, you can now craft infinite amounts of these cores. And since it would be gruesome to let your golem work just for one single core, you decided to only request cores in a large batch of 16. How nice of you.

#Quest_398.Kill Baba Yaga
gtnh.quest398.name=Kill Baba Yaga
gtnh.quest398.desc=Baba Yaga is a witch (or one of a trio of sisters of the same name), who appears as a deformed and/or ferocious-looking elderly woman. She flies around in a mortar and wields a pestle. She dwells deep in the forest, in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs, with a fence decorated with human skulls. Baba Yaga may help or hinder those that encounter or seek her out.

#Quest_399.Kill Horned Huntsman

Chips with higher priority value will receive items first until the inventory is full then will be sent to other inventories with valid filters and remaining space.\n\n-Dynamic item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network that match items inside the dynamic item responder connected inventory. This chip has to be in the same interface pipe as the item responder chip in order to work. Priority rules apply here as well. \n\n-Item overflow responder works exactly the same as the item responder chip, however it only accepts items that cannot go to an item responder chip, dynamic item responder chip, or item terminator chip. \n\n-Item terminator chip works as a backup for responder chips.\n\n-Item broadcaster chip will show you the inventory connected to the routed request pipe on the pipe network and can be used to retrieve items from it. They can also extract for wich side you configure them. \n\n-Item stock keeper chip will constantly check the network for items and pull them to its pipe. If the chip is set to pull when empty, it will only pull if the inventory next to it is empty, otherwise it will pull when there are less items in the inventory than configured in the chip.\n\n-Item crafting chips craft things. \n\n-Item crafting extension chips are placed inside the item crafting chips. Make sure you randomize the id.

Next to it add as much drawers as you want, and make sure they are touching each other or the controller.\n\nThe next step is to connect a routed interface pipe to your drawer controller. Take the item responder chip and configure it to filter mode: blacklist (this will allow you to get any items from your system) and add the chip to the routed interface pipe by right clicking on it. Don't forget the dynamic item responder.\n\nIn order to allow your system to be able to see items you need to add the item broadcast chip TO THE SAME ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE WICH IS CONNECTED TO THE DRAWER CONTROLLER.\n\nThe last step is to connect a routed request pipe IN THE SAME NETWORK AS THE ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE and right click it to acess the GUI. You can only extract items from it. In order to insert items simply right click them on the drawer controller. \n\nYou can find more complex tutorials on youtube for autocrafting.

#Quest_1138.Kinetic Wind Power
gtnh.quest1138.name=Kinetic Wind Power
gtnh.quest1138.desc=The Kinetic Wind Generator generates energy from wind power which varies randomly, although certain factors can change this. \nUnlike the Windmill, the Kinetic Wind Generator will require maintenance in the form of the Rotors. These are needed to run the Kinetic Wind Generator.\nOnce a Rotor is placed inside the GUI, the block is given sufficient space, and the current wind level is adequate for the current rotor, the Kinetic Wind Generator will begin to generate Kinetic Energy. \nThis can be converted into EU by using a Kinetic Generator attached to the correct face (the black circle).\nAbout Wind\nFirst off, the wind strength of a particular area is affected by 3 factors: Height, Weather, and Chance. The higher up in the world you are, the higher the wind level. Below y64, there is never enough wind to be used, and KWG's will not function at all. Weather will also give boosts; Rainy weather will give a 20% boost to normal wind levels, and stormy weather will give a 50% boost. The final factor of chance makes the wind strength vary randomly, however there is a limited range of variation.\nThe easiest way to check the current wind level in an area is by using a Windmeter.\nWind is strongest at around Y160, towards the build limit of Y255 there is very little wind, hence no point attempting to run Windmills that high.

#Quest_1139.Kinetic Water Power
