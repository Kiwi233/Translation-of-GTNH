# Quest.0 - §d§3§2§1§lYour first night
gtnh.quest0.name=§d§3§2§1§lYour first night
gtnh.quest0.desc=Your first task will be to find food, and a shelter for the night. The nights will be cruel, as this pack has hardcore darkness. It probably would be a good idea to collect some food now...\n\n§lNote: You don't need to keep this book, you can use tilde to open quests without the book.\n§5§5§o§o§n§m§m§n§n§l§n§e§d§c§b§a§9§8§8§7§6§5§4§r\nWe also maintain a wiki at §e§a§6§4https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page §rbe sure to check it out.

# Quest.1 - §1§lWhere is the flint?
gtnh.quest1.name=§1§lWhere is the flint?
gtnh.quest1.desc=As you might have noticed, while collecting gravel, no flint dropped for you. Well, there is a... recipe for that. Look up flint in NEI and craft some!

# Quest.2 - §1§lSticks 'n Stones
gtnh.quest2.name=§1§lSticks 'n Stones
gtnh.quest2.desc=This book has a built-in reading light, lucky you! Most probably you will read this text while you are waiting for the night to be over. Once it is, go out and collect some gravel and wood. Keep in mind that you need food, so look for Pam's Harvestcraft gardens. (And save some of the vegetables for seeds!)

# Quest.3 - §1§lStorage for days
gtnh.quest3.name=§1§lStorage for days
gtnh.quest3.desc=Now that you've unlocked 3x3 crafting, it's about time to make some storage for your goods. Take some of your wood, and craft a chest. You will need 4 wood, 4 planks and 1 flint.

# Quest.4 - §1§lMain Quests and Secondary Quests
gtnh.quest4.name=§1§lMain Quests and Secondary Quests
gtnh.quest4.desc=Now that you have made it this far notice the two new quests. See how these two quests look different? The quest with a crown is a main quest and is linked to other main quests by a thick line. You must complete the main quests to unlock the next tier. The other quest is an optional quest, and is not needed to unlock new tiers. However, optional quests often introduce you to useful items or processes.\n\nNot all main quests have a connecting line to guide you through your adventure because of book size. If there is not an obvious linked main quest at any point, try completing some of the other main quests available to you to progress.

# Quest.5 - §1§lTools
gtnh.quest5.name=§1§lTools
gtnh.quest5.desc=Now that you've got a shelter, crafting table, and a place to store your items, you should make some tools. (Unless you'd like to continue punching trees with your bare hand...)

# Quest.6 - §1§lYou reap...
gtnh.quest6.name=§1§lYou reap...
gtnh.quest6.desc=You won't always get food rewards from this book, so it might be a good idea to take care of that problem. As you've created a hoe already, go and find some water nearby and make a field.  With this modpack you can only make farmland within range of water. Let's trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.\n\nTo get other wheat, use a hoe on grass away from water. You'll get Witchery seeds too, save those for later. Start planting a cotton field, it's a key early game resource.

# Quest.7 - §1§l...what you sow
gtnh.quest7.name=§1§l...what you sow
gtnh.quest7.desc=If you, by chance, did read the previous quest and planted the carrot I gave you, then you're fine. Meanwhile, you should turn some more fruits and vegetables into seeds, and increase the size of your farm to get a steady supply of food.

# Quest.8 - §1§lGet that stone
gtnh.quest8.name=§1§lGet that stone
gtnh.quest8.desc=Look at you, with your shiny flint pickaxe! Time to mine some cobblestone. Yay! (And maybe you can improve this dirt-hut too...)

# Quest.9 - §1§lFire, fire, Grandpa!
gtnh.quest9.name=§1§lFire, fire, Grandpa!
gtnh.quest9.desc=Time to burn some stuff, isn't it? You can't make charcoal in it, but you sure will find some usage for it soon(tm).

# Quest.10 - §1§lRest in pieces
gtnh.quest10.name=§1§lRest in pieces
gtnh.quest10.desc=It's GLOPPing time! Go kill some pigs to gather meat. (And yes, they will drop cooked porkchops. Now isn't that useful...)

# Quest.11 - §1§lSharpness: Over... 5...
gtnh.quest11.name=§1§lSharpness: Over... 5...
gtnh.quest11.desc=It's about time to craft something more useful: A sword!\n\nNow that you have a sword, you will get credit for monster kills in the Kill all the things tab. Watch out, monsters in this world will chew you up and spit you out!

# Quest.12 - §1§lFluffy and red
gtnh.quest12.name=§1§lFluffy and red
gtnh.quest12.desc=Epic quest: Kill some sheep! (And try to get some wool, for a bed, obviously...)

# Quest.13 - §1§lSO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
gtnh.quest13.name=§1§lSO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
gtnh.quest13.desc=Sleepy time, and the end of Tier 0. Congratulations, you've built your first hideout, and you should have a steady supply of food by now. See you again in tier 1!

# Quest.14 - §3§5§lWhat is that...?
gtnh.quest14.name=§3§5§lWhat is that...?
gtnh.quest14.desc=You've seen a lot of trees, but there are a few that look really special. You are sure that these trees are much more than just wood to build your home with or used to get charcoal.\nThe best place to find them is in a Magical Forest, but if you can't find them there you can try a Garden or Cherry Wood Grove.\nIf you have trouble finding them, you can build a special compass in LV to help you locate the biomes.

# Quest.15 - §2§lReady, set, go!
gtnh.quest15.name=§2§lReady, set, go!
gtnh.quest15.desc=You probably should have a home by now. A steady supply of food is a fundamental requirement at all times. Take this journal to keep track of the things you've eaten. You will have to travel far in this tier, better be prepared!

# Quest.16 - §4§3§lBetter Tank... Iron Tank
gtnh.quest16.name=§4§3§lBetter Tank... Iron Tank
gtnh.quest16.desc=Storing more than 16 buckets of fluid in one tank? Sure! Just make an iron tank or upgrade the Buildcraft tank.\nDiamond tanks carry up to 64 buckets and obsidian ones are blast proof.

# Quest.17 - §2§lSand: The Gathering
gtnh.quest17.name=§2§lSand: The Gathering
gtnh.quest17.desc=In a strange vision you saw a big structure which would allow you to make charcoal. Finally some torches! According to your calculations, you will need a lot of sand for that.

# Quest.18 - §2§lBasic processing
gtnh.quest18.name=§2§lBasic processing
gtnh.quest18.desc=Most things are unavailable at the moment, so let's begin with something simple. Take some of your cobblestone and smelt it into regular stone. Since this modpack is evil, you'll need to use wood for that. How much fun is that?!

# Quest.19 - §1§2§lMaceration v0.1 Alpha
gtnh.quest19.name=§1§2§lMaceration v0.1 Alpha
gtnh.quest19.desc=This fancy little device works (almost...) like a macerator. Some people say it's even better, since it does not require power, yay! You only need to craft one for this quest, but you probably should make some more if you can...

# Quest.20 - §2§lGravel: The Gathering
gtnh.quest20.name=§2§lGravel: The Gathering
gtnh.quest20.desc=Your tools will eventually lose durability. You think it would be a good idea to collect more gravel in order to provide yourself with flint for more tools. Try searching near water.

# Quest.21 - §2§lClay: The Gathering
gtnh.quest21.name=§2§lClay: The Gathering
gtnh.quest21.desc=While bored, you thought that it might be a good idea to take up pottery. You should go and find some clay, the riverbanks should have some.

# Quest.22 - §2§lFinite water!?
gtnh.quest22.name=§2§lFinite water!?
gtnh.quest22.desc=Finite water is a problem, that's for sure. Last night, you had an idea. If you can drink cacti, you should also be able make water out of 8 cacti and use that for most recipes that require water. How cool is that? So what about another trade? 10 wood for... 3 cacti so you can setup a farm. Deal?\n\nTo automate the farm, place a string next to the cactus and a sand on top of the string. Now when the cactus grows, it will automatically break!  You can stack this horizontally and vertically to make a very efficient cactus farm.  Use water to redirect the cactus to a convenient pickup location or to above a hopper.\n\nFirst player to make a base running off of only cactus water gets a cape!

# Quest.23 - §2§lSomething to carry liquids
gtnh.quest23.name=§2§lSomething to carry liquids
gtnh.quest23.desc=You tried to move water with your bare hands, which didn't work at all. Luckily, you remember how to make a bucket out of clay dust.\n\nPut it in a mortar to get small clay dust which can be crafted to clay dust.

# Quest.24 - §1§2§lGetting (char)coal
gtnh.quest24.name=§1§2§lGetting (char)coal
gtnh.quest24.desc=It's time to get yourself some charcoal. For that, we're going to build a coke oven. Good that you just collected a lot of resources! (What a coincidence...)

# Quest.25 - §2§lAnother brick in the wall
gtnh.quest25.name=§2§lAnother brick in the wall
gtnh.quest25.desc=Your vision becomes more clear, you'll need bricks for your first multiblock structure. You think that 104 bricks should be enough. However, the bricks you'll need are somewhat special. Make sure to craft the correct ones!

# Quest.26 - §2§lForming press v0.1
gtnh.quest26.name=§2§lForming press v0.1
gtnh.quest26.desc=As you may have noticed, you cannot turn clay into bricks directly. Well, to be fair, it wasn't a good recipe anyway. You'll probably end up with something bread-shaped. So in order to make bricks, you need a form. Get yourself a knife and a blank pattern, and cut a brick sized piece out. It's as easy as that.

# Quest.27 - Finally, some power
gtnh.quest27.name=Finally, some power
gtnh.quest27.desc=Now that you have a coke oven, you can start producing charcoal. The more, the better. Don't worry about the creosote oil; I have another deal for you...

# Quest.28 - §2§lCopper sky, Iron curtain
gtnh.quest28.name=§2§lCopper sky, Iron curtain
gtnh.quest28.desc=With your newly acquired fuel source, you are now ready to process more advanced materials than stone or clay; Iron or copper, for example. Just in case you don't know, they spawn in rather large veins. Use the following quests to locate the most important veins.

# Quest.29 - §2§lAnother fuel source
gtnh.quest29.name=§2§lAnother fuel source
gtnh.quest29.desc=Lignite and regular coal are the fuel sources you'll definitely need. The latter can be turned into coal coke, which is a superior fuel source to smelt your first large batch of ore.

# Quest.30 - §2§lCopper
gtnh.quest30.name=§2§lCopper
gtnh.quest30.desc=Copper ingots can be created by smelting copper, chalcopyrite, or malachite ore.

# Quest.31 - §2§lTin
gtnh.quest31.name=§2§lTin
gtnh.quest31.desc=Tin ingots can be created by smelting Tin, Cassiterite, or Cassiterite Sand ore. Tin and Cassiterite ores are only found at high altitudes, but Cassiterite Sand ore is plentiful near the surface.\n\n§5§4Tip: If you get lucky and find a high altitude Tin/Cassiterite vein, save one of the Cassiterite ore to find your Mica vein later on using the ore finder wand.

# Quest.32 - §2§lBook parts
gtnh.quest32.name=§2§lBook parts
gtnh.quest32.desc=After you found a way to move water around, you had another brilliant idea: Paper! Paper is no longer made with sugarcane, you will now need wood pulp. You will need a lot of wood to craft wood pulp, so better grab your axe and go chop some trees.

# Quest.33 - §2§lTinker-time
gtnh.quest33.name=§2§lTinker-time
gtnh.quest33.desc=While using your flint tools is fun in terms of killing pigs and cows, they are not very good, and can't be repaired. You discovered how to craft tools that could be repaired and upgraded, but for that you definitely need a more advanced crafting technique.

# Quest.34 - §2§lAluminini...um...?
gtnh.quest34.name=§2§lAluminini...um...?
gtnh.quest34.desc=However it is spelled, you will need it. You can find it in chunks of gravel on the surface.\n\nUse as little as possible and save the rest for when you get a macerator in Steam age.

# Quest.35 - §2§lMaking bronze
gtnh.quest35.name=§2§lMaking bronze
gtnh.quest35.desc=Now that you've found copper and tin, you should make yourself some bronze. Use your macer... mortar to grind up some copper and tin ingots, and mix them together!

# Quest.36 - §2§lImportant tools
gtnh.quest36.name=§2§lImportant tools
gtnh.quest36.desc=In order to craft even basic machines, you'll need new tools. Most of them can be replaced by machines later. For now, you should become familiar with each of their recipes, as you will need a lot of these tools, starting today.\n\nYour new tools can also be used to make Railcraft water tanks, a very useful multiblock considering the finite water feature.\n\nYou want to make the non-electric versions of the screwdriver and wrench.

# Quest.37 - §2§lGetting iron
gtnh.quest37.name=§2§lGetting iron
gtnh.quest37.desc=Iron can be found in multiple veins. \nMagnetite veins (y 30-180), \nchalcopyrite veins (y 5-60), \nand limonite veins (y 10-40) all contain iron ore.

# Quest.38 - §2§lMaking better tools
gtnh.quest38.name=§2§lMaking better tools
gtnh.quest38.desc=With aluminium and copper, you can create a pretty durable material "Aluminum Brass", which can be used to cast better tools. These can be used to mine some more advanced ores.\n\nBut first you need a smeltery. See the Multiblock Goals chapter in this book, or find smeltery blocks in a village nearby.

# Quest.39 - §2§lBetter storage
gtnh.quest39.name=§2§lBetter storage
gtnh.quest39.desc=While standard chests are good for your basic items and goods, they are not ideal for storing a large amount of ore. You should build yourself some barrels in order to keep things organized.

# Quest.40 - §2§lYou shall proceed
gtnh.quest40.name=§2§lYou shall proceed
gtnh.quest40.desc=As you've gathered and crafted all materials and tools you need for your basic steam machinery, you may now proceed to the next tier. Keep in mind that you'll need mountains of resources in order to craft even the simplest things, so you probably should stock up on all ores in this tier. But that's up to you.

# Quest.41 - §2§lDon't burn your fingers!
gtnh.quest41.name=§2§lDon't burn your fingers!
gtnh.quest41.desc=You have decided it's time to make some tasty pizza, but your fingers got burned badly. Reading an ancient cookbook you discovered a pair of magical items that would allow you to carry anything hot, even lava in a bucket.\n\n§6§5The gloves have to be placed in the Baubles ring slots of Thaumcraft.\n\n§rFor the protection effect, the hot item has to be in your active slot. I wonder if there is some way to carry more than a few buckets at a time?

# Quest.42 - §2§r§2§lCow Tipper
gtnh.quest42.name=§2§r§2§lCow Tipper
gtnh.quest42.desc=Before you had to kill some pigs and sheep to complete quests. Now it's time to kill some cows and hopefully get some leather. If you are lucky and get a cow trophy you may never need to kill another cow in the future.

# Quest.43 - Cotton, cotton and more cotton
gtnh.quest43.name=Cotton, cotton and more cotton
gtnh.quest43.desc=You find out that cotton is very useful, it can be used to make string, wool, and some other useful items too. Make a small cotton plantation to get tons of it.

# Quest.44 - §3§lWelcome to Tier 1
gtnh.quest44.name=§3§lWelcome to Tier 1
gtnh.quest44.desc=Welcome, and well done so far! This tier is all about your first machines, getting more stuff from your ores and making bronze ingots in a more efficient manner.\n\nFor water, check out the Water Siding Tank multiblock in the Multiblock goals tab.\n\nTo connect up your boilers, be sure to provide water from the bottom.  Wooden pipes are fine for this.  Make sure you never run out of water - adding water to a hot boiler will cause it to explode!\n\nSteam will come out from the sides.  Remember, steam is hot!  It will destroy wooden pipes. And it can burn you if you walk on bronze pipes full of steam.  Cover them with wooden planks or paper.

# Quest.45 - §6§lMultiblock tanks... Railcraft tanks
gtnh.quest45.name=§6§lMultiblock tanks... Railcraft tanks
gtnh.quest45.desc=576 buckets of fluid, that should be enough to store all the creosote you have accumulated thus far. If that isn't enough you can make this tank bigger. The smallest tanks are 3x4x3 while the biggest are 9x8x9.\n\nHint: Fluid will auto-output (without any pumps) if you place a valve on the bottom side of the tank. You can color the tank with Buildcraft paintbrushes and the GT spray can.\n\nUse only Buckets to move fluids because cells get destroyed.

# Quest.46 - §3§lMore advanced alloys
gtnh.quest46.name=§3§lMore advanced alloys
gtnh.quest46.desc=Your smeltery does a great job mixing metals into alloys, but it's not very efficient, and limited in its complexity. You need something new, so why not put your steam to some use? \n\nIt might also come in handy when processing raw rubber. You should keep an eye on recipes to see when machines offer better options to make items...\n\n§4NOTE: Like all steam machines, the output port doubles as a steam outlet when recipes complete. It must not be blocked. Also, steam is hot, remember? Change the output sideby whacking with a wrench. The 3x3 grid will show you which side the output will move to when you whack it.

# Quest.47 - §3§lUpgrade: High speed alloys
gtnh.quest47.name=§3§lUpgrade: High speed alloys
gtnh.quest47.desc=Like most machines, there is a more advanced version of the alloy smelter. Keep in mind that this machine uses a lot of steam, so you better get some more boilers first. (This quest is optional)

# Quest.48 - §3§lA very important alloy
gtnh.quest48.name=§3§lA very important alloy
gtnh.quest48.desc=The most important alloy (until you reach a higher tier) is undoubtedly red alloy. Fortunately, you have an alloy smelter, so grab some redstone and combine it with copper to get yourself a handful of that.

# Quest.49 - §3§lThe hell is that?
gtnh.quest49.name=§3§lThe hell is that?
gtnh.quest49.desc=In order to get more machines, you'll need pistons. But not those amateurish ones, you need special ones, and I shall guide you in the making of them.

# Quest.50 - §3§lMacerator v1.0!
gtnh.quest50.name=§3§lMacerator v1.0!
gtnh.quest50.desc=Finally you are able to make a device that will replace your mortar. However, the "no-durability" feature of this device comes with a cost: You need 2 diamonds for the grinding heads.\n\nThe macerator will double your ore output. Put ores through it instead of smelting directly.\n\nNOTE: Remember, don't block the output port and don't stand behind it.

# Quest.51 - §3§lExtracting stuff
gtnh.quest51.name=§3§lExtracting stuff
gtnh.quest51.desc=As you'll need rubber later to make cables from wires, you should get yourself a steam extractor. You can also use this machine to get more dyes from flowers, or process different fruits into juice.

# Quest.52 - §3§4§3§lA clear view
gtnh.quest52.name=§3§4§3§lA clear view
gtnh.quest52.desc=Are you still living in your dirt hut/cobble hovel? How about letting in some sunlight? Grind up some sand and flint and craft some glass dust. Put it in your smeltery and pour it into a casting basin to make clear glass.\n\n§4Hint: In order to use it for recipes, you have to chisel it.

# Quest.53 - §3§lHammer time v2
gtnh.quest53.name=§3§lHammer time v2
gtnh.quest53.desc=Using 6 ingots to craft a hammer seems pretty wasteful, as this tool has durability. How nice would it be to have a machine that does the same but without having durability and using three ingots to make two plates? Guess what, there is one! And you should totally get one.

# Quest.54 - §4§3§lCompressing stuff
gtnh.quest54.name=§4§3§lCompressing stuff
gtnh.quest54.desc=This rather simple device does a very important job: compression. It's main function is to press 9 ingots into a block, but it's also useful for a variety of recipes, for example making firm tofu.

# Quest.55 - §4§3§lUpgrade: A better compressor
gtnh.quest55.name=§4§3§lUpgrade: A better compressor
gtnh.quest55.desc=An updated version of the steam compressor. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

# Quest.56 - §3§lUpgrade: Forge hammer
gtnh.quest56.name=§3§lUpgrade: Forge hammer
gtnh.quest56.desc=An updated version of the steam forge hammer. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

# Quest.57 - §3§lUpgrade: Extractor
gtnh.quest57.name=§3§lUpgrade: Extractor
gtnh.quest57.desc=An updated version of the steam extractor. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. You probably want to craft this, as the extractor does also extract your nerves... (This quest is optional)

# Quest.58 - §3§lUpgrade: Better macerator
gtnh.quest58.name=§3§lUpgrade: Better macerator
gtnh.quest58.desc=An updated version of the steam macerator. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

# Quest.59 - §3§lSteam alternatives
gtnh.quest59.name=§3§lSteam alternatives
gtnh.quest59.desc=There is more than one way to get steam for your machines. This completely optional quest shows you some alternative methods for producing steam.

# Quest.60 - §3§lUpgrade: Coal boiler
gtnh.quest60.name=§3§lUpgrade: Coal boiler
gtnh.quest60.desc=This is basically just an upgrade to your current coal boiler, however it produces more than twice as much steam. Something you should consider building if you're planning to get some of the upgraded machines.

# Quest.61 - §3§lAnother use for Java, I mean Lava
gtnh.quest61.name=§3§lAnother use for Java, I mean Lava
gtnh.quest61.desc=With a more durable steel casing, you can use lava to make steam.

# Quest.62 - §3§lThe power of the sun
gtnh.quest62.name=§3§lThe power of the sun
gtnh.quest62.desc=The sun has quite a bit of power, so why not use it to produce steam? \n\nFill it with water on the bottom side to produce steam. Unlike the other boilers, this only outputs steam on the output port side.\n\n§4Hint: The solar boiler calcifies and becomes less efficient over time.

# Quest.63 - §3§lUsing steam to cook things
gtnh.quest63.name=§3§lUsing steam to cook things
gtnh.quest63.desc=A rather slow process, but it's more efficient than using a regular furnace.

# Quest.64 - §3§lUpgrade: Better furnace
gtnh.quest64.name=§3§lUpgrade: Better furnace
gtnh.quest64.desc=An updated version of the steam furnace. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

# Quest.65 - §3§lBlastoff!
gtnh.quest65.name=§3§lBlastoff!
gtnh.quest65.desc=It's about time to make some steel. Look in the Multiblock Goals quest tab and build a Bricked Blast Furnace. Return here when you made at least 8 steel ingots.

# Quest.66 - §3§lTime for some logic
gtnh.quest66.name=§3§lTime for some logic
gtnh.quest66.desc=Good news! You are now able to advance to the next tier! Bad news: You still have to craft a lot of things before you can begin. Fear not mortal, I shall guide you!

# Quest.67 - §4§3§lWired, weird?!
gtnh.quest67.name=§4§3§lWired, weird?!
gtnh.quest67.desc=One of the very basic materials which you should memorize how to craft are wires and cables. Basically you just cut a plate into a wire with your wire cutter. Not very efficient, but there will be a better way later.

# Quest.68 - §3§lYour first electronic circuit
gtnh.quest68.name=§3§lYour first electronic circuit
gtnh.quest68.desc=Steam machines are quite stupid, they just do one thing over and over again. As you advance into the electrical age, you've decided that you want the machines to have more features, like automatic output in order to create some automation. For that, you need electronic circuits.

# Quest.69 - §3§lWire-Wrap
gtnh.quest69.name=§3§lWire-Wrap
gtnh.quest69.desc=Placing wires without insulation seems to be a bad idea. Now that you have an extractor to extract raw rubber out of sticky resin and an alloy smelter to further process it using sulphur, you should work on getting some insulating rubber sheets.

# Quest.70 - §3§lSteam-a-licious!
gtnh.quest70.name=§3§lSteam-a-licious!
gtnh.quest70.desc=You almost made it. One last crafting step is required in order to advance to Tier 2. Keep going!

# Quest.71 - §3§lBasic crafting: Motors
gtnh.quest71.name=§3§lBasic crafting: Motors
gtnh.quest71.desc=Motors are little devices that can turn electrical power into rotational energy. Very useful for all kind of machines, and not that difficult to craft. The pattern is always the same, only the materials change with tiers. For now you can use redstone to magnetize your iron rod. Later on you will build an Electromagnetic Polarizer.

# Quest.72 - §3§lBasic crafting: Rotors
gtnh.quest72.name=§3§lBasic crafting: Rotors
gtnh.quest72.desc=Rotors are also crafted using an identical pattern with different materials. A bit annoying to craft at the moment, but you don't need a lot of them anyway.

# Quest.73 - §3§lBasic crafting: Casings
gtnh.quest73.name=§3§lBasic crafting: Casings
gtnh.quest73.desc=All machines need a hull to keep their private parts together. Good news is: They are crafted in the same way for every tier, only the materials change.

# Quest.74 - §6§6§a§9§8§7§6§5§4§3§2§1§0§3§f§k§f§l§6§lYou are not prepared!!!
gtnh.quest74.name=§6§6§a§9§8§7§6§5§4§3§2§1§0§3§f§k§f§l§6§lYou are not prepared!!!
gtnh.quest74.desc=It's time for something really big: A smeltery! There's a lot to craft, so better gather some resources...\n\nThe aluminium oreberries can be planted on cropsticks, and macerated to get small quantites of aluminium for molds if you cannot find aluminium gravel.\n\nNote: The book says a 3x3 base, but you can make a smeltery with a smaller base.  Taller/wider smelteries can do more items at one time, conserving fuel.

# Quest.75 - §6§lThe water dilemma
gtnh.quest75.name=§6§lThe water dilemma
gtnh.quest75.desc=Finite water is a problem. But fear not, there are solutions! I shall guide you to a steady supply of water. The Railcraft water siding tanks provides enough water to last the early game.\n\nThe humidity of a biome is very important and will increase the base fill rate.\n\nIf it is raining, the tank will fill much quicker.\n\nAt least one block of the water siding tank must see sky for the maximum output.\n\nThe best part is that you don't need a pump to extract water.  Tanks and pipes placed next to it will be autofilled by the water siding tank.\n

# Quest.76 - §6§lTime to get some steel
gtnh.quest76.name=§6§lTime to get some steel
gtnh.quest76.desc=You need steel? Uhh... fine. Let's get busy...\n\nHint: The bricked blast furnace can share walls with other ones, just like most GT multi blocks. How will this affect the air quality though...\n\nIf you are short on Stone Dust, you can get more by macerating cobblestone.

# Quest.77 - §r§6§l§5§l§o§l§r§6§lEBF-Time
gtnh.quest77.name=§r§6§l§5§l§o§l§r§6§lEBF-Time
gtnh.quest77.desc=In order to get alumin(i)um ingots, you need an electric blast furnace. It's another very important step towards victory, so let's get started.\n\nGetting the heating coils might be a little tricky...\n\n§4(You need 2 LV hatches with 4A of 32V total, or 3 LV hatches with MOOOORE power if the multiblock is not fully repaired)\n\n§rA few recipes produce CO2/SO2 as fluid. You can put an output fluid hatch to the top layer of the EBF to collect it otherwise it gets auto voided. It depends on the muffler hatch how much fluid you can recover. Max muffler recovers = 78 percent.\n\nMoron always says - Make Muffler Moint Mup.  Or point up, anyways.\n\nIf you want a really fancy EBF, you can add more input fluid hatches and store different fluids in each one.\n\n§4If the pollution gets really bad, check in GT++ Multiblocks for a pollution scrubber.

# Quest.78 - §6§lUpgrade #1: More heat - Kanthal Coils
gtnh.quest78.name=§6§lUpgrade #1: More heat - Kanthal Coils
gtnh.quest78.desc=Better materials need higher temperatures. You can just exchange the old coils with the new ones. Kanthal coils let you reach 2700 K. You can even reuse the old coils in other machines, how fancy is that!

# Quest.79 - §6§lUpgrade #2: Higher tier - Nichrome Coils
gtnh.quest79.name=§6§lUpgrade #2: Higher tier - Nichrome Coils
gtnh.quest79.desc=To reach the 3600k heat capacity of your EBF, so you can process high-tier materials like tungsten, you need nichrome heating coils.

# Quest.80 - §6§lCompress all the things
gtnh.quest80.name=§6§lCompress all the things
gtnh.quest80.desc=Martin's (DreamMasterXXL) favourite machine. Compress ALL the things! With explosives, of course. Boom today!\n\nNote: You might want to put this far from your living quarters, the pollution can get high really fast.

# Quest.81 - §6§lAt the end of...
gtnh.quest81.name=§6§lAt the end of...
gtnh.quest81.desc=...the universe everything freezes eventually. But waiting for the heat death of the universe might take too long. Therefore we present you the vacuum freezer. It should be good enough to cool your hot stuff. You will need a minimum of 16 frost proof machine casings, the rest depends on your setup.\n\nYou will need to make EV circuits in a cleanroom to build this machine.

# Quest.82 - §7§6§lAn unexpected Bonus
gtnh.quest82.name=§7§6§lAn unexpected Bonus
gtnh.quest82.desc=Because we're nice developers, we decided to add a little bonus if you happen to compress charcoal. Not only does it allow you to process more than 16 steel at a time (not in the bricked blast furnace), it also yields 10 times the burn time of a piece of charcoal. So one charcoal for free. This bonus only occurs on the first compression step. (But for fanciness, you should definitely get a quintuple one!)

# Quest.83 - §6§lHigh speed charcoal
gtnh.quest83.name=§6§lHigh speed charcoal
gtnh.quest83.desc=Sure, those coke ovens are nice, but they aren't even remotely fast enough to keep up with a large steam boiler. Luckily, there is an upgrade available! The creosote oil will not be produced, but the process will speed up dramatically. Who needs that nasty yellowish flammable stuff anyway...

# Quest.84 - §3§lWhere I can put all the liquids?
gtnh.quest84.name=§3§lWhere I can put all the liquids?
gtnh.quest84.desc=With your brand new alloy smelter you are able to combine two materials. What happens if you mix some obsidian dust and thickened glass? Obsidian glass, great. Your first tank that you can make would be a Buildcraft tank. This tank can carry up 16 buckets of a single fluid. It's possible to upgrade those tanks so they can hold up to 64 buckets.\nYou can also stack the tanks to increase capacity.

# Quest.85 - Smelt all the things stack wise...
gtnh.quest85.name=Smelt all the things stack wise...
gtnh.quest85.desc=...with this great invention! Uses power to smelt up to 2 stacks of items at once! Can't go any faster! \n\nHint: Parallel smelting depends on coils, consult your local doctor before use.

# Quest.86 - §6§lUpgrade #3: Upgrade tier 4 - Tungstensteel Coils
gtnh.quest86.name=§6§lUpgrade #3: Upgrade tier 4 - Tungstensteel Coils
gtnh.quest86.desc=To process more advanced materials like enderium, enriched naquadah or niobium-titanium you need more than 3600K. Time to upgrade your EBF... again.

# Quest.87 - §6§lSteel multiblock tanks
gtnh.quest87.name=§6§lSteel multiblock tanks
gtnh.quest87.desc=Do you want to have tanks that can hold double the amount of the iron ones? Go ahead and make a steel tank. All sizes allowed from 3x4x3 to 9x8x9 blocks (X and Z must be the same, and odd). Just like the iron tanks, the Buildcraft paintbrush and GT spray can colorize tanks for identification. Get started on that tank farm full of lube!\n\nHint: Fluid will auto-output (without any pumps) if you place a valve on the bottom side of the tank - valves cannot be on an edge!\n\nOnly use buckets or large fluid cells because 1000L GT cells get destroyed.

# Quest.88 - §5§r§5§lWelcome to Tier 2
gtnh.quest88.name=§5§r§5§lWelcome to Tier 2
gtnh.quest88.desc=Why, hello there! Seems you've made it into the electrical age. Don't be so quick to throw away your steam machines, you'll probably want to use them until you reach tier 3.

# Quest.89 - §6§lMV Steam Turbine
gtnh.quest89.name=§6§lMV Steam Turbine
gtnh.quest89.desc=If you decide to use steam in MV tier then it's time to build a steam turbine.

# Quest.90 - §5§lDamn you, wire cutter!
gtnh.quest90.name=§5§lDamn you, wire cutter!
gtnh.quest90.desc=Enough is enough. No more wasting gazillions of ingots just for a couple of wires. Now that you have power, you should go for a wiremill!

# Quest.91 - §5§lYou're gonna hate this #1
gtnh.quest91.name=§5§lYou're gonna hate this #1
gtnh.quest91.desc=The first item you'll need a lot of. If you want to pull items out of chests or barrels you'll need one. \n\nHint: Goes pretty well with item pipes or GT machines, adjust with a screwdriver.

# Quest.92 - §5§lYou're gonna hate this #4
gtnh.quest92.name=§5§lYou're gonna hate this #4
gtnh.quest92.desc=The fourth item you'll need a lot of, and is also a pain to craft. Arguably the most painful item ever. \n\n§4Hint: Works like a conveyor but can work with selected item slots, adjust with a screwdriver.

# Quest.93 - §5§lYou're gonna hate this #2
gtnh.quest93.name=§5§lYou're gonna hate this #2
gtnh.quest93.desc=The second item you'll need a lot. When you want to get fluid out of tanks you'll need one. \n\nHint: Attach to fluid pipes or GT machines. Adjust the direction and redstone behavior with a screwdriver. Place it on the side facing the tank or machine.  When looking at a pipe or machine, you can use the grid to place it on a side already touching another thing. You can use the grid with a screwdriver to adjust a cover on that side as well.\n\nWhen a GT pipe or machine has any cover, including a pump cover, wrenching the machine back into an item keeps the cover on that machine.  The cover stays with the machine in the same N S E W direction when it is placed down again. This way you can arrange pump and conveyor covers on a machine outside a tight spot and place it there. To remove covers, use the crowbar.\n\nIt can also be further upgraded into a fluid regulator that allows precise control of fluid transfer speed.

# Quest.94 - §5§lElectric macerator
gtnh.quest94.name=§5§lElectric macerator
gtnh.quest94.desc=It is highly recommended to get one of these, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to macerate something is a lot better when using EU.

# Quest.95 - §5§lYou're gonna hate this #3
gtnh.quest95.name=§5§lYou're gonna hate this #3
gtnh.quest95.desc=A piston, but more .. "electrical". The third item you are going to craft a lot of in the future.

# Quest.96 - §5§lSaving redstone
gtnh.quest96.name=§5§lSaving redstone
gtnh.quest96.desc=Tired of using 4 redstone for one magnetic iron rod? Well, good news for you! The polarizer doesn't need redstone, just a little bit of power. You don't need to attach this machine to a permanent power source, it runs fine on battery power.

# Quest.97 - §5§lAvengers, assemble!
gtnh.quest97.name=§5§lAvengers, assemble!
gtnh.quest97.desc=An absolute must have for fans of the movie. Oh, and to make all the things, of course.\n\n§4Hint: You can use the battery slot and other extra slot in the GUI to store unused configuration circuits.

# Quest.98 - §5§lNo more filing
gtnh.quest98.name=§5§lNo more filing
gtnh.quest98.desc=Why waste a full ingot to make a rod by using a tool which loses durability and takes even MORE ingots? With this little device, all your rod-needs shall be fulfilled (for now).

# Quest.99 - Bzzz... Whoom... (Defunct do not complete)
gtnh.quest99.name=Bzzz... Whoom... (Defunct do not complete)
gtnh.quest99.desc=Making some flawless crystals requires a precision laser engraver.\nAt MV level the precision laser engraver becomes more important.

# Quest.100 - §5§lPress all the things
gtnh.quest100.name=§5§lPress all the things
gtnh.quest100.desc=With the basic forming press you can make different food items, glass arrows and some Project Red components. \n\nAt MV/HV stage you can make rotors, various AE components and make copies of your molds and extruder shapes.

# Quest.101 - §5§lMjolnir!!! (electric forge hammer)
gtnh.quest101.name=§5§lMjolnir!!! (electric forge hammer)
gtnh.quest101.desc=Not really required, but it is a lot faster than the steam one and it can be automated. If you feel like ore washing is too slow, use this hammer. There are no recipes that require anything more than steam level to hammer something.

# Quest.102 - §5§lCutting things apart
gtnh.quest102.name=§5§lCutting things apart
gtnh.quest102.desc=An absolutely mandatory machine to have. It will cut rods into bolts, plates into casings, logs into planks, and all of that will be done with the highest possible efficiency. Totally worth it! \n\n§4Hint: Just add water. Later on lubricant will help it run faster.

# Quest.103 - §5§lGet ready for Tier 3
gtnh.quest103.name=§5§lGet ready for Tier 3
gtnh.quest103.desc=In order to proceed forward, you need to get aluminium. A lot of it. But for now, eight is enough to unlock this quest. Probably the best source for aluminium is clay or hardened clay from canyons, however you need an MV machine for that. So you need to find an alternative until you have enough dusts for your initial setup. Check back in your Tier 0.5 quests for hints.\nOnce you have the dusts, you will need to do the EBF quest in Multiblock Goals to turn the dusts into ingots.\nAlso check the Armor and Jetpacks tab for new unlocks.

# Quest.104 - §5§lYour magic progression
gtnh.quest104.name=§5§lYour magic progression
gtnh.quest104.desc=Now that you are able to produce aluminium, you may dig into magic. If you haven't unlocked basic thaumaturgy, try to find a silverwood and a greatwood sapling.

# Quest.105 - §5§lThe missing one
gtnh.quest105.name=§5§lThe missing one
gtnh.quest105.desc=It was once said... <basdxz> But ffs, add a plate bender to the LV tier book ...and then it popped into existence.

# Quest.106 - Your first automation
gtnh.quest106.name=Your first automation
gtnh.quest106.desc=Well, probably not the first, but definitely something big! You will need a cart assembler first.

# Quest.107 - Cart modules: Power Coal
gtnh.quest107.name=Cart modules: Power Coal
gtnh.quest107.desc=Your cart needs power, obviously. A cart can be powered via coal, solar, or lava. But for now you have to use a simple coal engine.

# Quest.108 - Automated (un-)loading
gtnh.quest108.name=Automated (un-)loading
gtnh.quest108.desc=You can fill and empty your cart manually, but it's a lot more convenient to automate item transfer, isn't it?

# Quest.109 - Cart modules: Farming
gtnh.quest109.name=Cart modules: Farming
gtnh.quest109.desc=Unfortunately, the basic farmer can't farm anything besides wheat, carrots and potatoes. It's not expensive at all, and probably the cheapest solution to give your automated food production a nice boost.

# Quest.110 - Cart modules: Storage
gtnh.quest110.name=Cart modules: Storage
gtnh.quest110.desc=A basic cart can't hold any items, so you need to attach special chests to it.

# Quest.111 - A simple cart
gtnh.quest111.name=A simple cart
gtnh.quest111.desc=In order to create or customize your cart you need a hull to attach your desired upgrades to. The wooden one can be used for really simple applications, but to farm wheat or wood, you need at least an iron one.

# Quest.112 - Cart modules: Wood cutter
gtnh.quest112.name=Cart modules: Wood cutter
gtnh.quest112.desc=The basic wood cutter will break after a while, but you never have to replace it. It can easily be repaired with diamonds.

# Quest.113 - §5§lBasic transport pipe
gtnh.quest113.name=§5§lBasic transport pipe
gtnh.quest113.desc=These pipes are rather simple and won't do anything on their own. But in combination with transfer nodes, you'll soon find out how great they are. Also, given the correct upgrades, they even surpass most other transfer systems.

# Quest.114 - §5§lBasic transport: Items
gtnh.quest114.name=§5§lBasic transport: Items
gtnh.quest114.desc=In order to transfer items, you need so called "nodes". There are some for pushing items into a pipe system, and later you'll have access to nodes that are able to pull items from attached inventories.

# Quest.115 - §5§lBasic transport: Fluids
gtnh.quest115.name=§5§lBasic transport: Fluids
gtnh.quest115.desc=Just like item nodes, liquid nodes transfer... liquids. But probably the best thing: They can all utilize the same transfer pipe!

# Quest.116 - §5§lAlloy smelter
gtnh.quest116.name=§5§lAlloy smelter
gtnh.quest116.desc=Upgrade your steam alloy smelter to an LV one.

# Quest.117 - §5§lGotta catch 'em all
gtnh.quest117.name=§5§lGotta catch 'em all
gtnh.quest117.desc=Sure, you can use wheat/potatoes/carrots to make animals follow you back to your base, but that can be tedious. A golden lasso is a proper solution for animal transportation.

# Quest.118 - §5§lBasic monster protection
gtnh.quest118.name=§5§lBasic monster protection
gtnh.quest118.desc=Spawning monsters in or near your base can be annoying. Especially if you happen to get infernal creepers. Luckily, there is a good way to prevent them from spawning at all.

# Quest.119 - §3§lA quite different storage
gtnh.quest119.name=§3§lA quite different storage
gtnh.quest119.desc=Regular chests can fill up rather quickly if you happen to collect mob drops like swords and/or armor. By using a cabinet, you can store up to 270 items of the same type.  Also, it doesn't need a dolly - you can break it normally and it will retain contents. \nPerfect for storing ic2 crops, Forestry saplings, or bees!

# Quest.120 - §5§lProtect your base; Tier 1
gtnh.quest120.name=§5§lProtect your base; Tier 1
gtnh.quest120.desc=One needs proper protection for ones home. So why not get some turrets for safety? At the moment, 2 Turrets are available: "Potato" and "disposable item". I assume you can guess what they do and how they work...

# Quest.121 - §5§lPassive defence
gtnh.quest121.name=§5§lPassive defence
gtnh.quest121.desc=A more "passive" approach to base defence are walls and fences. But seriously, where is the fun in that?

# Quest.122 - §4§5§lTurret base
gtnh.quest122.name=§4§5§lTurret base
gtnh.quest122.desc=Turrets must be placed on top of a turret base. Only the player who initially placed the base can access and configure the turret. So don't worry about people taking your ammunition.

# Quest.123 - §5§lWho needs that dirt anyway
gtnh.quest123.name=§5§lWho needs that dirt anyway
gtnh.quest123.desc=You probably have a ton of items floating around in your base. So why not use them to kill your enemies?

# Quest.124 - §5§lDon't play with your food!
gtnh.quest124.name=§5§lDon't play with your food!
gtnh.quest124.desc=Use it to kill zombies instead. Does only a little damage, but hey, who cares?

# Quest.125 - §5§lUpgrading intensifies
gtnh.quest125.name=§5§lUpgrading intensifies
gtnh.quest125.desc=Your turrets probably need more space to hold more ammunition, so why not get an upgrade for that?

# Quest.126 - §6§lElectrolysing all the things
gtnh.quest126.name=§6§lElectrolysing all the things
gtnh.quest126.desc=Collected a lot of dusts since you started with macerating, washing and centrifuging ores? Until now you couldn't separate them. It's time to get all the pure and valuable materials out of them.

# Quest.127 - Project red beginning
gtnh.quest127.name=Project red beginning
gtnh.quest127.desc=Welcome to Project Red!\n\nThis quest will teach you the basics of Projectred and show you how to set up a Ghetto AE system.\n\nThe Ghetto AE system will be really useful for sorting all of your first items\n\nFirst of all there are different types of pipes: \n\nItem Transport pipes are the most basic pipes, classified as Null-logic. They don't do anything besides connect other pipes together.\nItem Transport pipes only have the ability to take items that enter it and pass them along to another connected pipe. They will NOT connect to inventories at all. In a junction where there is more than 1 possible direction, item payloads will travel in a randomly selected direction.\n \nRouted pipes are the most advanced. These pipes 'communicate' with one-another to form pipe networks, in order to allow for incredibly complicated demand driven systems, with absolutely no redstone circuitry required.\n \nPressurized pipes are pipes that use a pressure based routing system where the payload travels to the closest inventory that can accept it. Finding the closest inventory is influenced by both distance and Pressure Resistance Pipes (which, to the path finder, are 1000 blocks long), but the actual path that items take is only influenced by distance.\n\nHowever, in order to control the logic of the routed pipes you will need special circuit chips.

# Quest.128 - §6§lIO, IO, it's off to EnderIO we go
gtnh.quest128.name=§6§lIO, IO, it's off to EnderIO we go
gtnh.quest128.desc=You've probably used EnderIO before. It's quite useful for a lot of things. But a lot of stuff has changed here, so let's start from scratch.

# Quest.129 - §6§lMachine chassis
gtnh.quest129.name=§6§lMachine chassis
gtnh.quest129.desc=All EnderIO machines still require the basic chassis, and it's almost the same recipe as before; Except that you need plates instead of ingots. But that shouldn't be a problem at all...

# Quest.130 - §6§lPortable tanks
gtnh.quest130.name=§6§lPortable tanks
gtnh.quest130.desc=Until now, you had to use buildcraft tanks to carry liquids around. Which can be a pain to do. These little tanks from EnderIO are able to push and pull liquids by themselves, as they have a built-in pump which is powered by some magic energy source. How convenient.\n\n§4Just be careful, because it will eat water cells instead of returning them.\n\nPressurized tanks are twice as large.

# Quest.131 - §6§lSimple RF power: Solid
gtnh.quest131.name=§6§lSimple RF power: Solid
gtnh.quest131.desc=By simply burning coal as fuel, this machine produces RF power. Enough for a basic machine setup. This machine will also accept compressed and multiple-compressed blocks.  Want to burn for 250+ days? Also, with double or octadic capacitors the output will increase and efficiency will improve. GT wiring can convert EU to RF, but EnderIO machines can be left safely out in the rain. \n\nMight be useful for Genetics machines since they consume excessive power when attached to GT wiring - Forestry and EnderIO machines work fine.

# Quest.132 - §6§lSimple RF power: Liquids
gtnh.quest132.name=§6§lSimple RF power: Liquids
gtnh.quest132.desc=This generator requires both water as coolant, and a burnable liquid as fuel. The amount of power it produces depends on the type of liquid used.

# Quest.133 - §9§lThe power of enderman
gtnh.quest133.name=§9§lThe power of enderman
gtnh.quest133.desc=Elevators are nice, but they are limited to vertical teleportation, and their range is also somewhat limited. Travel anchors do not have that limitation. You can teleport from one anchor to any other within range. You can name them and even set them as private. They have a 2s cooldown.

# Quest.134 - §6§lConduits
gtnh.quest134.name=§6§lConduits
gtnh.quest134.desc=Probably the most awesome way to transport just anything in multiple different ways. Get some conduits of each type. Higher tiers of each exist.

# Quest.135 - §6§lYet another wrench
gtnh.quest135.name=§6§lYet another wrench
gtnh.quest135.desc=The Yeta Wrench is more than just a regular wrench. While holding it, you are able to switch between conduit types, eventually allowing you to remove one specific conduit type from a bundle of many. Ctrl-Mousewheel will switch modes, also Shift-Leftclick allows you to open the configuration interface even if you don't have access to that side of the conduit.

# Quest.136 - §6§lImproving conduits
gtnh.quest136.name=§6§lImproving conduits
gtnh.quest136.desc=Conduits on their own are pretty awesome, but you can do better. By using filters and speed upgrades, you gain even more control over what they do and how fast they work.

# Quest.137 - §6§lMaking things pretty
gtnh.quest137.name=§6§lMaking things pretty
gtnh.quest137.desc=While conduits on their own are already awesome, you can also hide them if you want. There are 2 types of facades, basic and hardened. While basic ones are simple and easy, the reinforced ones are able to withstand explosions and mining with tools. You have to use your Yeta Wrench to remove it.

# Quest.138 - §5§6§lCome to the dark side...
gtnh.quest138.name=§5§6§lCome to the dark side...
gtnh.quest138.desc=...we have cookies.

# Quest.139 - Luke, I'm your father
gtnh.quest139.name=Luke, I'm your father
gtnh.quest139.desc=With that dark steel you got, you may now craft yourself a new set of armor. While pretty basic at first, it can be upgraded later to unlock powerful features.

# Quest.140 - §6§lDark steel tools
gtnh.quest140.name=§6§lDark steel tools
gtnh.quest140.desc=There are also tools made of dark steel. Each of them can receive upgrades. Hold shift to get the tooltip which will explain what you need in order to upgrade them.\n\nThese tools can also be enchanted like vanilla tools.\n\nThe Ender will increase wither skull and ender pearl drops. It can be upgraded to teleport the player.\n\nDark shears can be empowered, and then will shear a large area, including leaves. Handy for clearing away that giant redwood! Maybe you will find other uses for it.\n\nThe axe, once empowered, can be recharged wirelessly while in farming station.\n\nThe pick? Well, it can mine cobalt I guess if you haven't gotten a tool capable of that yet. You could keep it around to use for base decorations if your normal pick is too fast, I supose.

# Quest.141 - §9§lVibrant Crystals
gtnh.quest141.name=§9§lVibrant Crystals
gtnh.quest141.desc=Vibrant capacitor banks also need this magical crystal. Armor and tools can be upgraded too.

# Quest.142 - §6§lBrewing liquids
gtnh.quest142.name=§6§lBrewing liquids
gtnh.quest142.desc=This machine is not only capable of brewing more powerful burnable liquids, it can also be used to brew nutrient distillation, which might have further usage soon(tm).

# Quest.144 - §9§lAutomated crafting
gtnh.quest144.name=§9§lAutomated crafting
gtnh.quest144.desc=You know, yet another automated crafting solution...\nThe left grid sets the recipe.  The center box on the left will show the output. The right item grid is where you place resources. The output products will show up on the right center box.\nThis machine supports automation.\nYou can upgrade the machine with a Double-Layer or Octadic capacitor to increase power usage and speed.

# Quest.145 - §6§lOre processing kind of...
gtnh.quest145.name=§6§lOre processing kind of...
gtnh.quest145.desc=The endless ware between macerators and SAG mills rages on eternal, so why does it matter which one you choose?\n\nHV Macerators are still required for the final byproducts on many ore chains, but a SAG mill still shines through with\nupgraded grinding heads! SAG mills are perfect machine for getting the most from your ores without using bees and crops.\nYou can get bonus outputs with tungsten grinding heads, but that doesn't mean you can dupe materials (like ingots) with it.\n\nPlus for many of them you'll get the final output directly without any need for further processing.  Handy for processing Redstone to get Chrome!\n\nIt's great for lead, copper, tin, silver, nickel, redstone, ruby, lapis, certus quartz, and malachite ores. Other ores will give you better outputs as well if you use a good enough head.\n\nEven coal, charcoal,bones, wheat, ender pearls, and charcoal non-ores will give bonus outputs.\n

# Quest.150 - §6§lHootch
gtnh.quest150.name=§6§lHootch
gtnh.quest150.desc=The lowest tier of renewable, burnable fluid. Generates 60 RF/t, but can be automated for "green" infinite power.

# Quest.151 - §6§lAutomated mob-farming
gtnh.quest151.name=§6§lAutomated mob-farming
gtnh.quest151.desc=Of course... zombies love that... disgusting liquid. While using a small amount per hit, he will attack everything that is within his range. That also includes players, so be careful. Rumors are there might be a weapon that will never break when used in this "machine"...

gtnh.quest162.name=§9§lDimensional goal: Moon
gtnh.quest162.desc=HV is the age where you should focus on reaching the Moon, as soon as possible. You will need titanium in large quantities. \n\n§4Hint: more info will be found in the Space Race quest tab.

# Quest.163 - §9§lI see everything
gtnh.quest163.name=§9§lI see everything
gtnh.quest163.desc=The inventory panel is an alternative to your (hopefully?) existing project red storage system. Just like project red, you have to connect every chest/barrel with an item conduit.

gtnh.quest169.name=§9§lThe creation of life
gtnh.quest169.desc=By utilizing large amounts of energy, you're able to re-activate those broken spawners you may have found in the past. If you haven't, you should get one of them now.

# Quest.170 - §9§lSpecific enchantments
gtnh.quest170.name=§9§lSpecific enchantments
gtnh.quest170.desc=Enchanting books is, just as it is for items, random. And that is annoying if you need a specific enchantment on your tool or armor. Now there is a way to actually select enchantments, for a price, obviously.

# Quest.175 - §9§lFire in the hole
gtnh.quest175.name=§9§lFire in the hole
gtnh.quest175.desc=Ah, there is nothing like an explosion and the certainty that your enemies have been blasted into tiny pieces.

# Quest.176 - §a§lTier 5
gtnh.quest176.name=§a§lTier 5
gtnh.quest176.desc=The main goal here is to get a tier 2 rocket, and reach Mars. You also might want to rethink your power setup, as more and more machines will be upgraded. This quest set will teach you about a couple of options you have regarding power production.\n\nMultiblock goals includes quests for the large gas turbine, large combustion engine, and multiblock ore drill.

# Quest.177 - *Poke*

gtnh.quest178.name=It's storage time!
gtnh.quest178.desc=Now that you've reached the High Voltage age, you might consider starting to work on your applied energistics system. It might be small, and it might be tricky to power it at first, but it's really worth the effort. You should start by getting all 4 different inscriber patterns.

# Quest.179 - Find them all
gtnh.quest179.name=Find them all
gtnh.quest179.desc=There are a lot of asteroids on the surface, but there are more underground. In order to find those, you need a compass.

# Quest.184 - Cables
gtnh.quest184.name=Cables
gtnh.quest184.desc=To have access to your applied energistics network from your entire base, you'll need cables. A lot of them. For now, the basic ones will do, but eventually, you'll end up using dense cables and p2p channels. Glass and Covered cables are functionally identical, just different in looks. Each can carry 8 channels.  Quartz fibers don't carry channels but can carry energy. This is useful for providing power from your main network to independant subnetworks.\n\nYou can also color your cables - cables with different colors will not connect, so those can be used to expand network capacity by running parallel cables. Only fluix colored cables connect to all other colors. Later it will probably be more efficient to use P2P channels to jam a bunch of channels into 1.\n\nAnchors are like covers, keeping things from connecting when you don't want them to.

# Quest.185 - Terminals everywhere
gtnh.quest185.name=Terminals everywhere
gtnh.quest185.desc=The ME Terminal is a HID which gives you access to an ME network's networked storage.\n\nIt has the ability to sort and search, as well as filter by using a view cell. It requires a channel to function.\n\nCan be upgraded into an ME crafting terminal.\n\nThe ME crafting terminal is the upgraded version of the ME terminal which has an integrated crafting grid with access to an ME network's networked storage.\n\nLike the ME terminal it also requires a channel to function.\n\nGives remote access to all interface pattern slots on your network separated by which type of machine they are on. It will show the type of machine in the terminal, however you can name the ME interface in the inscriber or an anvil to alter the name displayed in the ME interface terminal.\n\nCombined with the fact that you can toggle if the interface shows up at all this gets you control over your interface terminal's display.

gtnh.quest189.name=§a§lHEV Mark III protective system
gtnh.quest189.desc=Some things are dirty, and some things are even dangerous. You'll play with nasty stuff here, so better prepare yourself for the worst.\n\nSome items will give you a Radiation debuff without protection. How fast you get it depends on the item. Some items will give you enormous amounts of time with it, which will kill you because there is no way to get rid of it. \n\nOther items will give you a general sickness with many debuffs, but not Radiation. That can be removed the normal ways, Milk, Terrawart, Aqua bees, etc.

# Quest.190 - §a§lAppropriate power
gtnh.quest190.name=§a§lAppropriate power
gtnh.quest190.desc=Whether you used magic, steam, oil or biogas for power until now, you will run into problems as you advance to higher tiers. So you need to upgrade your power grid, at least for your blast furnaces. So let's start with something more powerful: A nuclear reactor!\n\n§4Hint:\nThe multiplier is set to 10x in this pack. That means your nuclear reactor is 10 times more efficient.\n\nFor some ideas on nuke setups, check out https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-Nukes

gtnh.quest193.name=§a§lTier 1 fuel: Thorium
gtnh.quest193.desc=The weakest of all rods, but very easy to produce, very easy to keep cool and runs twice as long as uranium. A perfect "fission and forget" power source.\n\nHint:\nAfter they are used up you can recycle them to get Lutetium which is used for make americium in the fusion reactor.\nAmericium is needed for top tier materials later, so start stockpiling now. Plus, you get power!

# Quest.194 - §a§lMonitoring your reactor
gtnh.quest194.name=§a§lMonitoring your reactor
gtnh.quest194.desc=It's important to monitor your reactor (Or just fancy to have a big screen somewhere...). So now that you've gained knowledge about the available fuel rods, you can start to build yourself a power plant. Here is something to help you out.\n\nUse the sensor kit on the block you want to monitor, then put the sensor card in the display panel.  Next select which lines of information you want to display.

# Quest.195 - §a§lIncreasing the capacity
gtnh.quest195.name=§a§lIncreasing the capacity
gtnh.quest195.desc=To unleash the full potential of your reactor, you have to attach six reactor chambers to it.

# Quest.196 - §a§lMove the heat
gtnh.quest196.name=§a§lMove the heat
gtnh.quest196.desc=Reactors heat up, well the rods do, so you need to "move the heat away" to somewhere else. You should get one of each, and try to figure out what each individual heat exchanger does, in order to figure out a good setup.

# Quest.197 - §a§lVenting heat
gtnh.quest197.name=§a§lVenting heat
gtnh.quest197.desc=You can't just move the heat around, eventually you need to get rid of it. Just like the exchangers, there are different types of vents, each of them has a certain usage you'll need to find out.

# Quest.198 - Double the fun
gtnh.quest198.name=Double the fun
gtnh.quest198.desc=Need even more power? Why not combine rods? Produces twice the amount of power (and heat, obviously) but only uses up one slot.

gtnh.quest199.name=§a§lQuit exhaling dusts
gtnh.quest199.desc=The QED is used for stuff like the ender quarry (yay!) and advanced mob-protection.

# Quest.200 - §a§lAdvanced mob-protection
gtnh.quest200.name=§a§lAdvanced mob-protection
gtnh.quest200.desc=Like the chandelier, the magnum torch prevents monsters from spawning. However, its range is quite big, so a single one might be enough for your entire base.\n\n§4Don't forget, monsters can still follow you home!

# Quest.201 - §c§lAutomated mining
gtnh.quest201.name=§c§lAutomated mining
gtnh.quest201.desc=The QED enables you to assemble the most convenient device for mining: The ender quarry.\n\nAs 0lafe says, "This small black box is life-changing" and "Sympathy for the amount of dense obsidian plates you need."\n\nGuess you better get compressing!\n\n§4NOTE: It's best to place your quarry and markers on orevein boundaries. This way you start getting ores right away, especially from planets and the deep dark dimension.

# Quest.202 - §c§lAccelerating things
gtnh.quest202.name=§c§lAccelerating things
gtnh.quest202.desc=If an ender quarry won't satisfy your needs for MOOORE. A speed upgrade is required.

# Quest.203 - Bundled AE channels
gtnh.quest203.name=Bundled AE channels
gtnh.quest203.desc=P2P tunnels. You will need a lot of them! These are fancy fluid/item pipes that will transport fluids or items from one "point" to "another".  Items transportered will not show up on crafting terminals etc, they just use the network as transport.\n\nThey can also pack up to 32 channels into 1 bundle and transport those to the destination p2p bus.  Each P2P tunnel requires 1 free channel. The network carrying the P2P must be separate from the network with the channels. These P2P connections cannot be nested, but one transport cable can carry multiple P2P connections.\n\nA nice online guide can be found at https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-AE2 under P2P tunnels.

gtnh.quest225.name=Searching for answers
gtnh.quest225.desc=Last night you had a dream. A dimension, so strange and different, exactly like the sapling you found. You decided to go there and look for answers.\n\nFirst you need a portal crystal to open it up. And no, a diamond is not enough.

# Quest.226 - See the unseen
gtnh.quest226.name=See the unseen
gtnh.quest226.desc=Everything is made of 6 primal aspects. Those aspects can be combined to form compound aspects, but in the end, there are only 6. Like the infused shards you found. You noticed that those shards start to vibrate when you bring them next to something that is made of the respective aspect. Maybe you can create a device to actually "scan" items, and reveal their compounds? This could be very useful later on.

# Quest.227 - Tables to work on
gtnh.quest227.name=Tables to work on
gtnh.quest227.desc=Indeed, the idea with the bookshelf did work. Now you need a nice table to do some research on, and probably something to infuse items with vis while crafting. Maybe you should try to smite a table with your wand.

# Quest.228 - Bloody water

gtnh.quest231.name=Tome of knowledge
gtnh.quest231.desc=All the things you've discovered so far, you need to write them down. But you are lazy, and you have a wand, so why not try a magical way to "write down" your research? You wonder if you could enchant a book with your wand, so that it will keep track of your progress... You should try that on a bookshelf!

# Quest.232 - Improving your wand
gtnh.quest232.name=Improving your wand
gtnh.quest232.desc=Your wand does a great job in storing and releasing vis as you please. However, those iron caps are... Weak. If you don't pay enough attention to it, it might hurt the node. Maybe you should try to improve it with caps made out of a more valuable material. Like.. gold, perhaps?

# Quest.233 - Getting shards
gtnh.quest233.name=Getting shards
gtnh.quest233.desc=Now that you found all six primal types of infused stone, you need to break those up in order to get the shards. The easiest way to do that, is to throw these stones in your Forge Hammer. Later when you have a Sifter, you can sift purified ores for more shards. An autoclave can turn shard dust into a shard. Maybe there is a magical way to do the same thing?

# Quest.234 - A "greater" wand
gtnh.quest234.name=A "greater" wand
gtnh.quest234.desc=While doing all your research and mining of these infused stones, you had an idea how to actually use the wood of a Greatwood tree to make a new wand.

# Quest.235 - Better screws
gtnh.quest235.name=Better screws
gtnh.quest235.desc=Unfortunately, your aluminium screws don't work with the greatwood rod. Somehow, the wood seems to repel the material. Luckily, you already have a blast furnace, so you can get a better material than aluminium.

# Quest.236 - A more powerful "scale"
gtnh.quest236.name=A more powerful "scale"
gtnh.quest236.desc=The naga scales are weak, they can only hold a very limited amount of vis. You need a better, more powerful component to store vis in your wand. You've heard rumors about an evil wizard in the Twilight Forest. Maybe he has... something... that can be used?

gtnh.quest253.name=Turning liquids into essentia

# Quest.256 - Not coal
gtnh.quest256.name=Not coal
gtnh.quest256.desc=Way better. To be fair, it's a waste to use coal itself, but it also works with charcoal and lignite dust. And it speeds up the dissolving of items in an alchemical furnace.

# Quest.266 - More durable screws
gtnh.quest266.name=More durable screws

# Quest.276 - Bring it home
gtnh.quest276.name=Bring it home
gtnh.quest276.desc=You probably have a nice collection of bookmarked nodes. But running around to recharge your wand(s) isn't really the way an adept thaumaturge should get his required vis. Moving nodes is not that hard, but without doubt, you need something to protect them from each other.

Activating the oven to show the interface screen, you will see an additional slot to the right of the fuel slot. Clay jars must be placed in this slot. If there are clay jars present when something is cooked, there is a chance a by-product will be captured in one of the jars. These by-products are important ingredients in other recipes. If there are no clay jars in the oven when something is cooked, no by-products will be produced.\n\nUpgrading an Oven\n\nAn oven can be upgraded by placing either a Fume Funnel or a Filtered Fume Funnel to the left and right of it. Each Fume Funnel will increase the cooking speed by and additional 10 per cent (over a furnace) and increase the chance of a by-product being produced by and additional 25 per cent for a Fume Funnel or 30 per cent for a Filtered Fume Funnel.\nAn Oven can use at most two upgrades and they must have the same facing as the oven.\n\nA fully upgraded oven will therefore cook at 130 per cent speed (compared to a furnace) and have a chance of a by-product of 90 per cent.

It is important to check that there is sufficient available power to perform a given rite or use a distillery or kettle recipe.\n\nThe maximum amount of power available is determined by how many natural items are in the vicinity of the altar: dirt, grass, trees, plants, etc. all contribute; stone and sand do not. The important thing is to have a diverse mix of different plants, trees and crops (plants from other mods are supported to an extent as well).\n\nCertain objects (or foci), placed onto an altar, will boost the focusing capabilities of an altar, either improving the amount of magic it can focus, the rate at which it replenishes or the range it can distribute power. Only one of each type of item (skull, chalice, etc.) will have an effect. There may also be other less savory foci that dark magic practitioners could make use of.

gtnh.quest334.desc=The second thing you'll need is a cauldron. It is used to craft most of the basic items, like mutandis.\n\nIt is made by placing a regular Cauldron in the world, and then using Anointing Paste on it.\n\nTo brew a potion, cast a ritual or create an item, the cauldron must first be filled with water. This can be achieved by using three buckets of water on it, pumping water into it using pipes, or by using a Dispenser containing a Brew of Endless Water.\n\nOnce a cauldron is full of water, it must boil. Lighting a fire beneath the cauldron is the only way for this to happen. Using a netherrack block will guarantee the fire does not go out, although if it does go out, it may be set to boil again without any consequences (unlike brewing in a Kettle!).\n\nWhen the water is boiling, ingredients may be added to the Cauldron (one after another), to create the desired effect. The book, Witches' Brews gives a complete overview of all ingredients and what they can do when added to a brew.

# Quest.335 - Don't touch the needle!
gtnh.quest335.name=Don't touch the needle!
gtnh.quest335.desc=While having not many recipes by itself, the few it has are rather important for your further witchery progression.

# Quest.336 - Probably usable for soup
gtnh.quest336.name=Probably usable for soup
gtnh.quest336.desc=But its main purpose is to brew potions and infusions.\n\nA kettle must be set up in the correct way, before it may be used. \n\nFirstly, a fire must be set under the kettle (netherrack is best for this, but wood will do just as well). \n\nNext the kettle must be filled by using a Water-filled Bucket on it. \n\nThirdly, each of the six ingredients for the brew or infusion must be thrown into the kettle, one at a time (the liquid will change color according to the recipe being used). \n\nFinally, a glass bottle must be used on the kettle to bottle the resulting brew, this must be done multiple times depending on the recipe.\n\nIt is important to keep the fire going constantly while the recipe is being prepared, otherwise it will be ruined. Swirls coming from the kettle is a sign all is well, black smoke (and brown liquid) indicates the brew is ruined. When a brew is ruined, the kettle must be emptied with a glass bottle, or just filled with more water, and the whole process repeated.\n\nWhen a brew is complete, the liquid will be the color of the resulting brew and will splutter (in addition to white swirls).\n\nSome recipes will require magical energy from a nearby Altar before they are bottled. If the brew is bottled when insufficient energy is available, the brew will be ruined. Black swirls coming from the Kettle is a good sign there is not enough power. A kettle must be within 14 (to 16) blocks of an Altar in order to obtain power from it (it can obtain power only from a single altar).

# Quest.337 - Don't shake it too much
gtnh.quest337.name=Don't shake it too much
gtnh.quest337.desc=Unlike nitroglycerin, this stuff doesn't explode. But you still shouldn't shake it too much...

# Quest.338 - Spirit coin transfer
gtnh.quest338.name=Spirit coin transfer
gtnh.quest338.desc=The Potion of Spirit can only made in the spirit world. Wondering how you can get your stuff like the Kettle, Spinning Wheel or Cauldron to the spirit world? Well you can bypass it probably on servers with the enderchets but for single player or a server without any enderchest you can transfer a few coins to the spirit world and buy some stuff. Don't claim the coins until you have already passed to the other side.\n\nYou have already collected a few coins in quests. Let's transfer them now and save it in a chest.\n\nIt's a repeatable quest so you can do it as long you have enough coins.

# Quest.339 - Circle magic
gtnh.quest339.name=Circle magic
gtnh.quest339.desc=For circle magic, you need... a circle, obviously. There are 4 types of chalk you can use, and you'll need all of them to proceed.

# Quest.340 - Portable power source
gtnh.quest340.name=Portable power source
gtnh.quest340.desc=By infusing a stone with fiery magic you can create an "Attuned Stone". These stones can be used to link non-magical devices to the magical currents present...

# Quest.341 - Flying OINKment
gtnh.quest341.name=Flying OINKment
gtnh.quest341.desc=You tried, it doesn't fly. And it also doesn't make any OINK sounds, sadly. But there might be some use for it...

# Quest.342 - Nimbus 1999
gtnh.quest342.name=Nimbus 1999
gtnh.quest342.desc=Not as good as its successor, the 2000'ish model, but still "somehow" useful...

# Quest.343 - Bloodlust: Refined evil
gtnh.quest343.name=Bloodlust: Refined evil
gtnh.quest343.desc=Refined good was out of stock, sorry.

# Quest.344 - Bloodlust: Witches hand
gtnh.quest344.name=Bloodlust: Witches hand
gtnh.quest344.desc=In case you don't like the infernal witches...

# Quest.345 - Bloodlust: Seeping shoes
gtnh.quest345.name=Bloodlust: Seeping shoes
gtnh.quest345.desc=Who needs an antidote? Now with free fertilizer!

# Quest.346 - Bloodlust: Taglock kits
gtnh.quest346.name=Bloodlust: Taglock kits
gtnh.quest346.desc=Get a death protection poppet and get a stack of taglock kits. For all your trolling needs.

# Quest.347 - Bloodlust: Drop of luck
gtnh.quest347.name=Bloodlust: Drop of luck
gtnh.quest347.desc=Hard to get, even with that quest. But less of a grind...

# Quest.348 - Bloodlust: "Cain" sword
gtnh.quest348.name=Bloodlust: "Cain" sword
gtnh.quest348.desc=Serves 2 purposes: Style. And... ah, yeah... Something useful for vampires.

# Quest.349 - Be a vampire; Dress like a fancy person
gtnh.quest349.name=Be a vampire; Dress like a fancy person
gtnh.quest349.desc=Sometimes it can be troublesome to get fancy clothing. However, if you prove yourself worthy, you get a set for free.

# Quest.350 - A few more things...
gtnh.quest350.name=A few more things...
gtnh.quest350.desc=Ok, I think I have everything I need to assemble the device. Can you assist me with some additional materials? I need to update most of my machines, as these exotic components you got me damaged most of them already. Don't worry, I have a list here.\n\nMost of my circuits burned to a crisp while I was trying to measure the conductivity of these soul and life shards. I need better ones.\n\nGood lord, these mysterious crystals have eaten away my diamond grinding head! How could that happen? Can you get me a better one?\n\nDo you see that pile of chrome over there? No? Neither do I. Because the machine was VAPORIZED! Good that you gave me 2 singularities, the first one... Well... Just get me a better casing, would you?\n\nIt seems, that the stabilizers need... stabilizing... But I'm out of field generators. Can you help me with this?

# Quest.351 - Hello there
gtnh.quest351.name=Hello there
gtnh.quest351.desc=I've observed your pathway, and I have to say, I'm impressed. I might need your help soon, on a big project of mine.

# Quest.352 - Power. So much power!
gtnh.quest352.name=Power. So much power!
gtnh.quest352.desc=If only I could harness it... Well, hi there my friend. I need your help with a project of mine. I want to create an immense power source, but I have a few problems that I need to solve first. Will you help me? You will be rewarded.

# Quest.353 - A problem that matters
gtnh.quest353.name=A problem that matters
gtnh.quest353.desc=I need to open a wormhole. But for that, I need an immense gravitational field. One like those created upon the death of a massive star. But I can't really "kill" a sun for this. I need to compress matter somehow... \nBut... How?

# Quest.354 - Now that matters!
gtnh.quest354.name=Now that matters!
gtnh.quest354.desc=Of course! The matter condenser! How come I didn't think of that?

# Quest.355 - I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest355.name=I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest355.desc=Opening the wormhole is one thing, but I need to stabilize it, so it doesn't harm anything. I guess I need something made of crystal. Why? Because I like it fancy. Find me a crystal-based, transparent material with immense power, would you?

# Quest.356 - Shiny!
gtnh.quest356.name=Shiny!
gtnh.quest356.desc=What in the world is this? This is amazing! I need more of these! They will be an amazing containment material for the wormhole!

# Quest.357 - I'm hungry
gtnh.quest357.name=I'm hungry
gtnh.quest357.desc=What... I work a lot! So get me some food please.

# Quest.358 - It needs a power plug...
gtnh.quest358.name=It needs a power plug...
gtnh.quest358.desc=Given the fact that I will be able to craft this device, it needs some kind of "plug" to get the power out. I need something to conduct immense amounts of power. I thought about superconductors, but they don't fit with the crystal casing material I have in mind. I need 2 different crystals, one for positive and one for negative charge.

# Quest.359 - Red and blue
gtnh.quest359.name=Red and blue
gtnh.quest359.desc=Really? A red and blue crystal? How awesome is that! I think I will need 8 of each color, just to be sure.

# Quest.360 - A casing
gtnh.quest360.name=A casing
gtnh.quest360.desc=I need something for the outer shell. Again, a crystal-based material would be best, because I like it shiny. I tested all crystals we know and none of them meet the requirements. I heard you have access to outer space? Can you try to find a suitable material while you're out there?

# Quest.361 - Fancy!
gtnh.quest361.name=Fancy!
gtnh.quest361.desc=Yes. Yes! That's it! Bring me more of this stuff! I probably need a lot of it...

# Quest.362 - Beyond imagination
gtnh.quest362.name=Beyond imagination
gtnh.quest362.desc=What is this? Draconium dust? I wonder if I could use this for something...

# Quest.363 - The power of dragons
gtnh.quest363.name=The power of dragons
gtnh.quest363.desc=Hey my friend. I got your sample, and I have to say, I'm amazed. This material has a lot of potential, but it's useless at the moment. I have an idea how to turn this into something useful, but I need you to help me with a few problems first.\n\nI need a good handful of that stuff for my research. Please get me some.

# Quest.364 - A hull
gtnh.quest364.name=A hull
gtnh.quest364.desc=First things first, we need a hull. I played around with your sample, and it seems that it reacts with every known material. It even attacks Iridium! It's completely harmless if it's in a box that is open, but as soon as I try to enclose it in something, poof. It breaks free. We need something stronger than iridium my friend.

# Quest.365 - Dense, denser, Neutronium
gtnh.quest365.name=Dense, denser, Neutronium
gtnh.quest365.desc=Now look at this. This stuff is incredibly dense. Maybe this material will be sufficiently strong?\n\nThis looks promising. Send me some samples, and I will try my luck.

# Quest.366 - Not a planet
gtnh.quest366.name=Not a planet
gtnh.quest366.desc=This place is interesting. Maybe I should try to find new materials here...

# Quest.367 - Successful.. Or not?
gtnh.quest367.name=Successful.. Or not?
gtnh.quest367.desc=Heh, neutronium. I didn't even know such a thing really exists. Unfortunately, the draconium dust was enclosed for... 5 seconds? But, it was a small success. \n\nOk let's travel to some planets and moons and look for the new material. I think we have to fly very far away for it.

# Quest.368 - Black Plutonium
gtnh.quest368.name=Black Plutonium
gtnh.quest368.desc=This doesn't seem to be dense, but it's a material you haven't seen before. Maybe this could be the solution?\n\nBlack what? Huh, interesting. Send me some samples, I want to analyse it.

# Quest.369 - We have a hull
gtnh.quest369.name=We have a hull
gtnh.quest369.desc=Surprisingly, this material is able to contain the draconium dust. It could be the radiation. Good job my friend!

# Quest.370 - Draconium Dust core
gtnh.quest370.name=Draconium Dust core
gtnh.quest370.desc=I've created a first sample of what I shall call "Draconium Dust core". Not quite the result I expected to be honest, but see for yourself.

# Quest.371 - We need to control it
gtnh.quest371.name=We need to control it
gtnh.quest371.desc=The problem is that the immense power of this dust is released all at once. We need something to control the vast amount of energies. I noticed that the dust starts to glow when it gets near an aura node. Maybe Thaumaturgy has the solution?

# Quest.372 - The power of primals
gtnh.quest372.name=The power of primals
gtnh.quest372.desc=What else could control energies better than a focus of crystallized primal energy? With this little item, it should be possible to control the energies released from the dust.

# Quest.373 - Unforeseen consequences
gtnh.quest373.name=Unforeseen consequences
gtnh.quest373.desc=You haven't heard anything in a while from the technician. You have a feeling that something might have gone terrible wrong, so you went to his place to investigate. What you found was... nothing. A void. It seems that he tried to combine the pearl with the dust. What did he say? The dust reacts to aura nodes? Of course it does. It amplifies the energies by a thousand times. And giving it raw primal energy, good lord, what has he done. May he rest in peace...

# Quest.374 - I'm on my own now
gtnh.quest374.name=I'm on my own now
gtnh.quest374.desc=I need to continue my research. I still think that this primordial pearl is the key to control the dust, but I'm not sure how. Maybe the pearl is just too strong? I should try to use something that's similar, but less powerful. It reacts to vis, so maybe.. I should try to make a wand focus with that pearl. That way, I could channel vis into the dust without actually combining both.

# Quest.375 - An interesting material
gtnh.quest375.name=An interesting material
gtnh.quest375.desc=This metal has quite interesting properties. It seems that it has absorbed some of the energy that exists in the End. While ender pearls are quite fragile, this metal is a lot more durable. However, the absorbed energy is not enough to teleport things around. But you might find a solution for this.

# Quest.376 - Gross, what is that...
gtnh.quest376.name=Gross, what is that...
gtnh.quest376.desc=It's purple, and it smells like rotten eggs. But while staring at this unpleasant fluid, you had an idea. You can't reach the dust directly, but can you actually teleport something in and out the field? Might be worth a try.

# Quest.377 - An appropriate focus
gtnh.quest377.name=An appropriate focus
gtnh.quest377.desc=You've tried a lot, and nothing was quite enough to activate the dust. Until now. You finally found a focus that is able to transmit enough power to cause a heavy reaction with the dust, but not enough to cause problems.

# Quest.378 - Activated draconium dust
gtnh.quest378.name=Activated draconium dust
gtnh.quest378.desc=At least for a short period of time. The wand focus is powerful enough to activate the dust, but it will convert back to regular dust as soon as I stop feeding it with vis. If I only could contain it, surround it with a forcefield...

# Quest.379 - The strongest forcefield
gtnh.quest379.name=The strongest forcefield
gtnh.quest379.desc=In order to create a forcefield, I need to build myself a containment device. I will use only the best emitters I can afford. I will take no risks here.

# Quest.380 - Not what I expected...
gtnh.quest380.name=Not what I expected...
gtnh.quest380.desc=The outcome was... interesting. It did not explode, instead, the activated draconium dust generated a counter-field to mine! Unfortunately, the emitters could not stand the reverse energies, and melted. I was able to shut it off quick enough to save the machine casing (At least what's left from it...) And a couple of field generators.

# Quest.381 - Forcefield, second try
gtnh.quest381.name=Forcefield, second try
gtnh.quest381.desc=I came to the following conclusion: Draconium dust seems to react nicely with all kinds of magic energy, and seems to repel technology. So I need to find a way to create a forcefield with magic alone. There must be a way...

# Quest.382 - A magic force field
gtnh.quest382.name=A magic force field
gtnh.quest382.desc=While node stabilizers are too weak, you found a way to generate a strong containment field, generated by magic itself. You tried to use warded glass, but even the "frozen in spacetime" material could not resist the power of activated draconium dust. You decided to build another device, this time with your newest invention.\n\nThe vortex attenuator is powerful enough to negate even hungry nodes, and it also will be able to contain activated draconium dust.\n\nJust to be sure, I will add some amplifiers to it.

# Quest.383 - What the...?
gtnh.quest383.name=What the...?
gtnh.quest383.desc=The device works! It is able to fully contain and separate the draconium dust from everything around it! Unfortunately... It also prevents the vis from passing the barrier, which results in regular draconium dust... In a forcefield...

# Quest.384 - Looking for alternatives
gtnh.quest384.name=Looking for alternatives
gtnh.quest384.desc=It is frustrating. Either you are able to contain the dust but can't activate it, or, you activate it and it causes serious damage. Maybe you need to find answers somewhere else.\n\nDraconic... Like... Dragon?

# Quest.385 - Draconic... Like... Dragon?
gtnh.quest385.name=Draconic... Like... Dragon?
gtnh.quest385.desc=Maybe you where looking for the right things in the wrong place. As this dust obviously comes from dragons, the best thing to do now is to find answers in the dimension of dragons: The End.

# Quest.386 - Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.name=Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.desc=These ghosts are weird beings. But, I found this ectoplasm, which, by itself, seems to be pretty useless.

# Quest.387 - Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.name=Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.desc=By a random guess of yours, you combined molten ender pearls and a few more of these shards with an empty gem, and it turned blue. It is pulsating with power. You tried to use it on your containment device, and it seems to be able to bypass the force field, while keeping it intact that the same time. Sadly, it doesn't have enough power to let vis pass through. Maybe you can even further increase the gems power?

# Quest.388 - Arcane shards
gtnh.quest388.name=Arcane shards
gtnh.quest388.desc=While the normal world is based on vis and primal energy, the End seems to be quite different. This arcane shard is the crystallized form of this energy, just like the primal shards that you used so many times in the past. By pure randomness, you discovered that it reacts with the metal you've found.

# Quest.389 - Draconic evolution
gtnh.quest389.name=Draconic evolution
gtnh.quest389.desc=I found a way to combine technology and magic into something fantastic. A shiny blue emblem that emits immense amount of energy. I've decided to call it the draconic core. Make one for yourself!

# Quest.390 - Balanced thaumium
gtnh.quest390.name=Balanced thaumium
gtnh.quest390.desc=This new metal is quite cheap, and has an awesome conductivity towards all 6 primal aspects. Regarding the capsule, I'd say it is a superconductor for vis. I think I can finally assemble the final frame.

# Quest.391 - Automated evolution
gtnh.quest391.name=Automated evolution
gtnh.quest391.desc=The machine is working pretty well, but it's tedious to fill in the reagents manually. But you have an idea, you could use a few basic components to fully automate the process.\n\nYou can use robot arms and conveyor belts to automate the input and output.\n\nObviously, you need to power the machines. A solar panel will do just fine.\n\nIn order to automate the catalyst, you need a few things. One golem will gather basic materials, while the second one will hunt creepers and ghasts for the more valuable ingredients.\n\nYou found a way to re-use the singularity, so you only need to get some sand. Luckily, the golem that works on the catalyst will be able to get glass too. He just needs a little additional motivation.\n\nYour golems need light, obviously. Also, it would be nice if there are some signal lamps that indicate the status of the process. Would it not?

# Quest.392 - Activated teleport gem
gtnh.quest392.name=Activated teleport gem
gtnh.quest392.desc=You are sure that you've just discovered the solution for your containment problem. This gem happily transmits vis on request, while keeping the containment field intact. What a great day!

# Quest.393 - You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.name=You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.desc=Now that you are able to contain the activated draconium dust for an infinite amount of time, you where able to assure the energy it releases. The readings are incredible. You have never seen such a power before. The only problem is, the machinery required to keep the dust in this state is too large to use it for crafting.\n\nYou noticed something that might help: The dust reacts to vis, but it needs a lot of it, therefore you require the animation focus. If you could find a catalyst, that you can mix the dust with, you could make the dust react with the vis from its surroundings instead of a direct beam.

# Quest.394 - A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.name=A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.desc=That's it. This catalyst contains all primal energies in a quite different form, a lot weaker than any node. However, in combination with the draconium dust, it amplifies the vis that's around it, which leads to a permanent activation. It still needs to be contained, but you don't need the direct vis beam any more.\n\nThe result is a compound, which still emits massive amounts of power, but is less destructive. It still attacks the neutronium, but I think if I can find a capsule-like container that has special properties, I could create a portable version of it.

# Quest.395 - Bulma would be proud
gtnh.quest395.name=Bulma would be proud
gtnh.quest395.desc=By combining a dimensional singularity with some glass cylinders and molten gold, I was able to create a miniature containment field within a very small area. Interesting enough, the new draconium blend amplifies the containment field from the inside. Once I fill the blend in the capsule, it immediately "seals" itself. I won't be able to remove or replace the dust any more, but I don't think I have to...\n\n\nThe perfect vessel for massive power!

# Quest.396 - The final steps
gtnh.quest396.name=The final steps
gtnh.quest396.desc=Now that I've found a way to stabilize the draconium dust and keep it safe in a small capsule, I just need to make a small container for it, so I can drain the energy on demand. Neutronium will serve very well, but I need a magic conductor. Thaumium works, but gets way too hot and void metal has a bad conductivity. I need to find a magic alloy that is more "balanced" in terms of primal aspects

# Quest.397 - Endless evolution
gtnh.quest397.name=Endless evolution
gtnh.quest397.desc=Using your machine, you can now craft infinite amounts of these cores. And since it would be gruesome to let your golem work just for one single core, you decided to only request cores in a large batch of 64. How nice of you.

# Quest.398 - Kill Baba Yaga
gtnh.quest398.name=Kill Baba Yaga
gtnh.quest398.desc=Baba Yaga is a witch (or one of a trio of sisters of the same name), who appears as a deformed and/or ferocious-looking elderly woman. She flies around in a mortar and wields a pestle. She dwells deep in the forest, in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs, with a fence decorated with human skulls. Baba Yaga may help or hinder those that encounter or seek her out.

# Quest.399 - Kill Horned Huntsman
gtnh.quest399.name=Kill Horned Huntsman
gtnh.quest399.desc=A Horned Huntsman is a member of the Wild Hunt, a powerful entity created by the Horned God. If one is encountered, prepare for a hard fight, or better flee.

# Quest.400 - Kill Ender Dragon
gtnh.quest400.name=Kill Ender Dragon
gtnh.quest400.desc=The dragon must die. Long enough he destroyed those precious endstone blocks!

# Quest.401 - Kill Shade of Leonard
gtnh.quest401.name=Kill Shade of Leonard
gtnh.quest401.desc=Leonard is the demonic being who is rumored to have taught a cadre of German witches their trade, and often presided over their sabbats. A skilled coven with the witches cauldron can summon a Shade of the Demon according to the method described in the Witches' Brews book.

# Quest.402 - Kill Lord of Tormentum
gtnh.quest402.name=Kill Lord of Tormentum
gtnh.quest402.desc=A Lord of Torment is a mighty demonic being that is able to create prisons to torment its victims. Those foolish enough to summon one of these creatures must prepare for an arduous fight.

# Quest.403 - Kill Mog and Gulg
gtnh.quest403.name=Kill Mog and Gulg
gtnh.quest403.desc=Mog and Gulg are the god-like beings that hobgoblins worship. They may send their avatars to pay witches a visit who exploit their worship (with a statue of hobgoblin patron). Rumor has it that using a nether star may make them take immediate notice.

# Quest.404 - Kill Demon
gtnh.quest404.name=Kill Demon
gtnh.quest404.desc=Demons are powerful, evil beings who dwell in the infernal dimensions. To date, none have been seen roaming the Nether, where their minions: ghasts, blazes and their ilk seem to dominate. To meet a demon without a way to protect oneself is almost certain death. They are known to hit like a proverbial truck, and require a significant amount of damage to kill. Some demons have even been seen shooting fireballs! They are, of course, also immune to fire.

# Quest.405 - The power of infinity
gtnh.quest405.name=The power of infinity
gtnh.quest405.desc=You've mastered everything possible. And now it's time to give your equipment the final boost. The infinity egg is just the right addition to your altar. It's quite expensive, but well worth the cost.

# Quest.406 - Lava for blood
gtnh.quest406.name=Lava for blood
gtnh.quest406.desc=Well, both are red, so that connection was quite obvious... Was it...?

# Quest.407 - Tier 1 slates
gtnh.quest407.name=Tier 1 slates
gtnh.quest407.desc=The basic slates. Basically just stone with blood infused in it.

# Quest.408 - See all the things
gtnh.quest408.name=See all the things
gtnh.quest408.desc=It's quite difficult to see how much blood there is in your altar, or your personal blood network. This little device will solve that problem for you. Just a little prick in the finger, and everything will be revealed.

# Quest.409 - Basic rune
gtnh.quest409.name=Basic rune
gtnh.quest409.desc=The basic rune that you can craft at this moment.\n\nYou need  8 runes for your tier 2 altar, which can hold more blood, and you can make new recipes now.

# Quest.410 - Alchemy with blood
gtnh.quest410.name=Alchemy with blood
gtnh.quest410.desc=Not like "blood alchemy". You probably will need more than one later, but for now one is sufficient.

# Quest.411 - Potion catalysts
gtnh.quest411.name=Potion catalysts
gtnh.quest411.desc=In order to manipulate potions you need catalysts. You then combine the ingredient you used to get the potion effect in with either a lengthening or power catalyst to increase the duration or the strength of the potion effect.

# Quest.412 - Simple alchemical things
gtnh.quest412.name=Simple alchemical things
gtnh.quest412.desc=Alchemy can be weird, and tedious. There are a lot of reagents and even more possible combinations. For now, and in order to get started, you need a couple of basic things.

# Quest.413 - Refilling your potions
gtnh.quest413.name=Refilling your potions
gtnh.quest413.desc=If empty, you don't have to throw the potion away. Just refill it.

# Quest.414 - Special potion flasks
gtnh.quest414.name=Special potion flasks
gtnh.quest414.desc=Regular glass phials are unable to hold these special potions you want. You need to imbue them with some blood from your altar.

# Quest.415 - Potion: Flight mode

gtnh.quest482.name=§2§lAnimal farms
gtnh.quest482.desc=Trying to get some leather or wool?

# Quest.492 - §2§lSheep hairdresser

gtnh.quest502.name=A new home
gtnh.quest502.desc=Now that you've destroyed the poor bees homes, you should build them a new one. The humble Bee House will not let your bees mutate into new species. But you'll need the combs anyways for better housing.  The production rate isn't too bad, but they cannot be automated.\n\nOne tip - Put some vanilla saplings near the Bee Houses. Bee Houses give a natural boost of 3x to pollination vs better housing. The bees will pollinate them and you might get lucky and start getting some Forestry tree crossbreeding. Stick with Oak and Birch trees, they'll give you a nice mix of starter Forestry trees.

# Quest.503 - Analyze them all
gtnh.quest503.name=Analyze them all
gtnh.quest503.desc=Every bee has multiple properties that define what the bee does, how it behaves in rain or at night, and a couple of other aspects.

# Quest.504 - Scan or not to scan
gtnh.quest504.name=Scan or not to scan

gtnh.quest506.name=To play god

This greenish, smelly liquid needs to be refined from bacterial sludge that seems to be available only on Mars. You will be able to continue, once you've arrived there.\n\nIn the meantime you can start working with the Genetics mod, since we all know Gendustry is too easy... Check out the recipes and you will understand why you should look into the Genetics mod.

# Quest.507 - Upgraded home
gtnh.quest507.name=Upgraded home
gtnh.quest507.desc=The Bee House can be used to stabilize mutations, for example if you have successfully bred two different bees, but the passive traits are different from the active ones. \n\nTo actually breed those together to get a new species, you'll need something different - the Apiary. Building them will require a Carpenter and Impregnated frames, along with Seedoil and Creosote - quite a bit of industrialization! Or, if you're lucky, you can find a beekeeper villager to trade with for useful items. Maybe you can help the villagers *get lucky* to make more beekeeper villagers? If only Cupid and his bow were around...\n\nProduction rates in an empty Apiary are low - lower than a Bee House by quite a bit, in fact.  But the Apiary has two big advantages - Frames, and Automation. You can now use your Untreated or Impregnated frames in here to boost output - and the boost is multiplied. So 3 x2 frames gives you 2 * 2 * 2 = 8x extra output!

# Quest.508 - Mutatron
gtnh.quest508.name=Mutatron
gtnh.quest508.desc=Mutations can be boring, they can be annoying, and most times, they are frustrating. With this machine, you will get a 100 percent pure bred mutation. If the combination of princess and drone can result in multiple mutations, the outcome is random. But who cares?\n\nYou can now upgrade your leftover Bees Advanced bags to Bees Expert in the last quest tab.

# Quest.509 - Genetic sampler
gtnh.quest509.name=Genetic sampler

gtnh.quest546.desc=During your travels you may have seen some of these huge oil spouts. Now it's time to go make a pump and put this black gold into tanks. Oil can be burned directly in a combustion generator or be refined for better fuels and crafting materials. \nMining pipes are needed for pumping the oil.\n\nBring a combustion generator with you to power the pump. Thanks to the advancement of technology the pumping machine can auto output on top.\n\nStacking multiple pumps makes them work faster. In that case, oil has to be removed from the bottom of the stack using a pump cover.\n\nTaller spouts have more oil! But for the LV pump, it is better to use the short spouts since it doesn't have much range. Save the taller spouts for MV pumps. \n\nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on any side. And set a waypoint with Journeymaps so you don't forget where you placed it!

# Quest.718 - §2§lMoron's Manual to Fecund Farms
gtnh.quest718.name=§2§lMoron's Manual to Fecund Farms
gtnh.quest718.desc=If you ever wanted to know how crop breeding works you are in the right place. Get some crops (the sticks) and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. \n\nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdWdFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd \nFFFdddFFF\nNow place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.\n\nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.\n\nWith some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.\n\nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel  or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.\n\nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds. \n\nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.\n\nDon't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. \n\nCrossing happens when 2 or more almost mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a 90 percent change of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation. More details in the IC2 cropnalyzer quest.

# Quest.719 - First Breeding
gtnh.quest719.name=First Breeding
gtnh.quest719.desc=New plants have grown on your crop sticks. You can harvest the crop by right clicking it.\n\nLeft clicking with a seed bag will destroy the plant and replace it with the seedbag, so be careful. Collect 8 seeds of any kind.\n\nTo unlock the next quest, you will need the LV scanner.\n\nIf you haven't already, go back to Steam and build some Filing Cabinets. They make storing and moving large quantities of seeds a breeze. Plus they will properly sort the seeds based on name. To find a specific seed, type its name in the NEI search bar, and double click the bar so it highlights yellow.  Now you can look through the Filing Cabinet and find the exact seedbag you want.

# Quest.720 - Weed II
gtnh.quest720.name=Weed II
gtnh.quest720.desc=Weeds, weeds, and more weeds. You get so many of them while cross breeding. \nNeed some  biogas cells for your power production in exchange? Or maybe some glowstone to light up your fields?

# Quest.721 - Unknown seeds no more
gtnh.quest721.name=Unknown seeds no more
gtnh.quest721.desc=You have a lot of unknown seeds already. Use your scanner to scan all the seeds.\n \nSeeds can be planted again to breed better and more resilient crops.\n\nLater you can use your portable scanner to see the crop stats while still in the ground.\n\nGrowability depends on having dirt beneath your crop(4 max), biome (swampy is best, followed by jungle and mushroom - basically any humid or wet biome such as tropical rainforest or bayou), air quality (Up toY=124 and don't place a lot above/around your plants), hydration, and fertilizer.  When the crop tier and plant stats get high enough, they will actually die without enough Growability.\n\nAs long as you water and fertilize them, you can pretty much grow crops anywhere, but as you improve the stats you have to optimize their environmental conditions.\n\nIf the Growth stat gets too high, greather than 24 or so, the plant will spread weeds onto neighbors.\n\nSome crops, such as Redwheat, require certain light levels to crossbreed or grow.

# Quest.722 - Speed up your plant growth
gtnh.quest722.name=Speed up your plant growth
gtnh.quest722.desc=To speed up the growth process a bit you can use a fertilizer. You will note, however, that bone meal no longer works. A bit of ash, apatite or calcite mixed with some water in a chemical reactor will give you the fertilizer you need. Apply by hand.

# Quest.723 - Potatos, Carrots, Pumpkins and Melons
gtnh.quest723.name=Potatos, Carrots, Pumpkins and Melons
gtnh.quest723.desc=Your seeds have three different values: Growth, gain, and resistance (GGR).\n\nThe only way to change a crop's GGR without 3rd party tools is through cross breeding. When two plants cross-breed, the resulting plant will have a GGR score that is between both "parent" plants' GGR. Sometimes it will also be a little bit higher or lower. Thus, to obtain high GGR scores you must go through numerous generations of crossbreeding.\n\nThe highest score for GGR is 31.

# Quest.724 - Weed
gtnh.quest724.name=Weed
gtnh.quest724.desc=Weed will show up from time to time on your crop sticks. Be careful and harvest the weed with your weed trowel before the whole field becomes overgrown with them and they destroy all your plants. Later you can make some weed Ex to destroy it.

# Quest.725 - Flower Power
gtnh.quest725.name=Flower Power
gtnh.quest725.desc=Growing dyes on crops sticks? Try to plant some flowers. If you cross breed Rose and Dandelion flowers you maybe get a new flower and new dyes with different colors.\n\nYou will need to plant 4 vanilla flowers to get them on a cropstick.\n\nTo get "Rose Seeds" place poppies.

# Quest.726 - §5§lChemical rubber production
gtnh.quest726.name=§5§lChemical rubber production
gtnh.quest726.desc=A much more efficient way to make insulated cables is by making molten rubber in a chemical reactor which can be applied to a cable in the assembling machine. When you put both machines next to each other you can output the molten rubber directly to the assembling machine by clicking the fluid auto-output button on the chemical reactor. Make sure to set the correct side of the reactor as output side by wrenching it.

# Quest.727 - §1§2§lBetter than barrels
gtnh.quest727.name=§1§2§lBetter than barrels
gtnh.quest727.desc=While barrels offer a slot for a single item, drawers can have up to 4 slots each (holding 16 stacks per slot). Once you reach HV you can combine them with some ProjectRed pipes to set up a "ghetto ME storage system" (Tec2k17).\n\nJust watch out, they do come with some downsides. You won't be able to make them point up or down, and you can only acces the contents from the front (automation can use any side). \n\nAlso, if placed on top of a hopper, they can bug out and void items when the hopper is full.  If you plan on that, use barrels or chests instead.

# Quest.728 - §2§lCompact Drawers
gtnh.quest728.name=§2§lCompact Drawers

# Quest.730 - §6§lBio Fuels
gtnh.quest730.name=§6§lBio Fuels
gtnh.quest730.desc=You are using steam, creosote, and possibly oil plus their by-products to generate Power. It's time to start with bio diesel. You can use wheat, sugarcane, apples, saplings or fish.\n\nBe sure you have a managed Forestry farm, Steve's Cart Farm, IC2 Crop Sticks with a harvester, or a lot of fish catchers because you need plenty of biomaterials for constant biodiesel production.\n\n§4Hint: Hazelnut is the ultimative source for biodiesel.

# Quest.731 - §6§lPlant balls
gtnh.quest731.name=§6§lPlant balls
gtnh.quest731.desc=The first step is to compress plantballs out of your wheat. Your LV compressor is too slow for it. I suggest crafting 4 MV compressors for the new bio diesel processing line.

# Quest.732 - §6§lPlant Mass
gtnh.quest732.name=§6§lPlant Mass
gtnh.quest732.desc=Macerate the plantballs down to plant mass for better processing. In the LV and MV tiers you get only one plant mass per, in HV tier you recieve two. IV macerator gives up to four of them with a chance of 50 percent and 25 percent.

# Quest.733 - §6§lBio Chaff
gtnh.quest733.name=§6§lBio Chaff

# Quest.736 - §6§lFermented Biomass
gtnh.quest736.name=§6§lFermented Biomass
gtnh.quest736.desc=With the MV fermenter you can produce fermented biomass. This is the base product to make methane, ethanol and methanol.\nWhen you reach HV tier there's a more efficient way to process it - the distillation tower multiblock.

# Quest.737 - Can u eat those? 
gtnh.quest737.name=Can u eat those? 
gtnh.quest737.desc=No you can't eat them but you can add them to your routed pipes. Without chips routed pipes can't do anything on their own, chips also have a GUI to configure them which can be opened by right clicking. \nThere are 8 types of chips:\n\n-Item extractor chip can be used to send items from its inventory to responder, dynamic responder, terminator and overflow responder chips in a pipe network. \n\n-Item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network which match the filter configured to the inventory connected to the responder chip. Chips with higher priority value will receive items first until the inventory is full then will be sent to other inventories with valid filters and remaining space.\n\n-Dynamic item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network that match items inside the dynamic item responder connected inventory. This chip has to be in the same interface pipe as the item responder chip in order to work. Priority rules apply here as well. \n\n-Item overflow responder works exactly the same as the item responder chip, however it only accepts items that cannot go to an item responder chip, dynamic item responder chip, or item terminator chip. \n\n-Item terminator chip works as a backup for responder chips.\n\n-Item broadcaster chip will show you the inventory connected to the routed request pipe on the pipe network and can be used to retrieve items from it. They can also extract from the side you configure. \n\n-Item stock keeper chip will constantly check the network for items and pull them to its pipe. If the chip is set to pull when empty, it will only pull if the inventory next to it is empty, otherwise it will pull when there are less items in the inventory than configured in the chip.\n\n-Item crafting chips craft things. \n\n-Item crafting extension chips are placed inside the item crafting chips. Make sure you randomize the id.

# Quest.738 - Routed Pipes
gtnh.quest738.name=Routed Pipes
gtnh.quest738.desc=There are six types of routed pipes: \n\n-Junction pipe is used to form an intersection that will allow other routed pipes to communicate. \n\n-Interface pipe will connect to an inventory allowing you to extract or insert items, chips can be used to control the logic. \n\n-Request pipe will allow requesting only specific items to be send through pipes.\n\n-Firewall pipe can control which items can pass through them.

# Quest.739 - Ghetto ME System
gtnh.quest739.name=Ghetto ME System
gtnh.quest739.desc=Now that you are familiar with the mod it's time to organize items in your base a bit. These are the things you need in order to get a basic extract/insert system.\n\nFirst of all you will need a drawer controller. You can pick it from here or craft it yourself and place it down. Next to it add as much drawers as you want, and make sure they are touching each other or the controller.\n\nThe next step is to connect a routed interface pipe to your drawer controller. Take the item responder chip and configure it to filter mode: blacklist (this will allow you to get any items from your system) and add the chip to the routed interface pipe by right clicking on it. Don't forget the dynamic item responder.\n\nIn order to allow your system to be able to see items you need to add the item broadcast chip TO THE SAME ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE DRAWER CONTROLLER.\n\nThe last step is to connect a routed request pipe IN THE SAME NETWORK AS THE ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE and right click it to access the GUI. You can only extract items from it. In order to insert items simply right click them on the drawer controller. \n\nYou can find more complex tutorials on youtube for autocrafting.

gtnh.quest761.desc=Powderbarrels are twice as good as dynamite in the implosion compressor. Craft one stack.

# Quest.762 - §6§lTNT
gtnh.quest762.name=§6§lTNT
gtnh.quest762.desc=TNT is much more powerful than the powderbarrel but much harder to craft. There are LV and HV ways to craft. At LV you need heavy or light fuel to make some toluene which can be solidified to gelled toluene. Alternatively you can use sugar and plastic dust in a chemical reactor to make toluene more efficiently. Mix it with sulfuric acid to make TNT.\n\nThe HV way requires an oil cracking unit to make all kinds of cracked fuel or cracked naphta and a distillation tower to extract toluene from that.

# Quest.763 - §6§liTNT

gtnh.quest765.desc=Pumps are nice but you're going to reach a point where you will want MOOOOOOOOOOOOORE oil. This multiblock will help with that but you will need to search for oil using a seismic prospector. You can find raw, light and heavy oil. There's also a chance to find natural gas.\n\nHigher tiers of power will drill faster. You need to upgrade the energy hatch corresponding to the power tier. \n\nLater you can upgrade the oil drilling rig so it extracts from more than one chunk at a time.\n\nYou need mining pipes in the machine controller block.\n\nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on any side. And set a waypoint with Journeymaps so you don't forget where you placed it!

# Quest.766 - §6§lLet's get crackin!
gtnh.quest766.name=§6§lLet's get crackin!
gtnh.quest766.desc=Cracking oil products like light and heavy fuel with the oil cracker is faster and more efficent than using a chemical reactor, producing 25 percent more output. Cracked products will result in additional by-products in the distillation tower. It is a smart idea to get this multiblock since you are going to need TONS of industrial TNT from Toluene for advanced tier rockets. \n\nThe 16 coils form 2 vertical rings of 8 on either side of the controller. The casings between the rings can be replaced with a hatch for steam/hydrogen input. Energy hatch and maintenance hatch can replace any of the casings. The input product hatch and output product hatch must replace one of the casings outside of the coils.\n\nHint: Only GT/Railcraft steam can be used, not ic2 steam.

# Quest.767 - §6§lAnalyzing the soil
gtnh.quest767.name=§6§lAnalyzing the soil
gtnh.quest767.desc=Tired of looking for ores by hand? Want to find deep oil that will last a long time? A seismic prospector will tell you the ores in the surrounding chunk in a handy book you can read, and also the oil in the oilfields beneath each 8x8 chunks.\n\nTo determine which kind of oil or gas there is in the chunk you need to scan the soil by right clicking an Advanced Seismic Prospector with 2 Powderbarrels, 4 Glyceryl Trinitate cells, 8 iTNT or 16 TNT.  Make sure you wait a few seconds after placing the prospector before applying the explosives.\n\nThen use a Data Stick to extract the data by right clicking on it after the animation has finished.\n\nNow you need to put the analyzed data stick in a GT scanner. Then place it in the bottom right slot of the printer and add 3 paper in the top left slot and make sure you have at least 144 mb squid ink in it. (Only gregtech machines will work)\n\nAfter the process is done take the printed pages and combine it with a piece of leather in an assembling machine filled with at least 20 mb of refined glue. Don't assemble more than one book at time.\n\nTADA now you have a book with detailed info about the chunks you scanned.\n\nNote: Each oilfield is 8x8 chunks, and always on a by 8 chunk boundary. Within the field the amount can vary +- 25 percent. The amount reported in the book is the minimum and maximum per oilfield across all chunks in the field. The prospector reports on 3x3 oil fields at all tiers with the center oil field where the seismic prospector is located. Oil extraction rate depends on many factors, check the wiki for details. In general, anything above 300 is really good. The total amount in the chunk is complicated. \n\nOre locations are given as the center of the chunk. Ores that are marginal in that chunk may not be found in the center but on an edge. Look at where ores are located and determine the center of the vein. At higher tiers, it scans more chunks for ores.

This large turbine can help you produce a tremendous amount of energy. It will also distill water for you, so you can use the same water again inside your large boiler.  Don't forget to make a rotor for the turbine. \n\nMake sure you provide the optimal flow of steam using a fluid regulator. Don't exceed your dynamo hatch's EU rating, or it will explode! For HV you will probably want an IC2 fluid regulator. Above HV you can use the fluid regulator covers.\n\nTurbines with a small turbine durability below 75k have their recipes removed. Use NEI with the appropriate long rod to find assembler recipes that will work for you. Long magnalium for small turbines, long titanium for normal turbines, etc.\n\nPre-moon, the best rotors are small ardite or vibrant alloy. Remember to disassemble rotor blades before they break to recover the materials.\n\nPost-moon, the best HV rotors are normal damascus or blue steel. Risk-takers can try ultimet but you must not provide optimal flow since it will give 517 EU/t, blowing up a single amp dynamo. Luckily turbines are now fully functional with multi-amp dynamos, so give those a try if you need extra amps!\n\nFor additional choices, see the Large Turbine Calculator in Discord.

gtnh.quest1111.name=A Chest for Bees
gtnh.quest1111.desc=A chest for bees only. It can hold up to 125 different bees in one chest.

# Quest.1112 - Frames
gtnh.quest1112.name=Frames
gtnh.quest1112.desc=Untreated frames are the simplest frames. They do not work in bee houses, only in apiaries. You will need them to craft bee houses.\n\nThey increase the bee's performance. Each untreated frame will double a bee's productivity.

# Quest.1113 - Impregnated Frames
gtnh.quest1113.name=Impregnated Frames
gtnh.quest1113.desc=Impregnated Frames are even better than untreated Frames. \nEach frame doubles the bee's productivity. It has a longer durability than the untreated frame, but a shorter one compared to the proven frame.

# Quest.1114 - Proven Frame
gtnh.quest1114.name=Proven Frame
gtnh.quest1114.desc=Proven frames are much better than impregnated ones.\nEach frame doubles the bee's productivity. Out of the three Forestry frames (Untreated, Impregnated and Proven), the proven frame has the longest durability.\n\nYou can make them or purchase them from a villager. If you can't find a beekeeper, there are couple of different options to get one. Rescue a zombie villager, add doors to a village to get them to make kids, or perhaps use a cupid's bow and arrow...

# Quest.1115 - Moron's Guide to Taller Trees
gtnh.quest1115.name=Moron's Guide to Taller Trees
gtnh.quest1115.desc=Forestry trees have a variety of attributes.  Once you get a tree with a useful attribute, you can breed that attribute into other tree species. This way you can get an ultimate tree that combines all the attributes you want - including the type of fruit! These breeding lines do not cover every option or even the best, but are great starts to get you into Forestry.\n\nIT IS RECOMMENDED YOU DO YOUR FORESTRY TREE BREEDING IN AN ENCLOSED AREA, OR UNDERGROUND. BUTTERFLIES ARE A KNOWN LAG SOURCE.\n\nFor faster tree breeding, enclose your trees so that butterflies cannot escape, and breed bees with better traits for area and pollination.\n\nGirth - The width of your tree.  Wider trees have more leaves, but will also need more saplings to begin growing. All saplings must be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW corner determines the stats of the new tree, and is where bone meal must be applied to mature the tree. Butternut already provides 2x2 girth.\n\nHeight - Controls how high the tree grows. Jungle trees are already Larger, but if you want Largest there is a guide to getting Cocobolo trees. There are rumors of rare villagers with Giant Sequoia saplings capable of reaching into the clouds...\n\nMatures - The growth speed of a sapling into a tree.  Important if you plan to cut it down right away for logs.\n\nSaplings - Chance of getting a sapling from a detroyed leaf. Balsa, a tree on the way to Cocobolo, has High number of saplings. Good for making into biomass or other uses.\n\nSappiness - The amount of biomass a sapling produces in the Fermenter. Boost Fermenter output more using honey or fruit juice. Blue Mahoe provides the highest sappiness, but Lemon and Plum are respectable.\n\nYield - Chances of getting a fruit from a destroyed leaf. Plum is the best here.\n\nFruit - Each fruit from various trees provides different advantages. Lemons are great sources of Fruit Juice but don't provide much Mulch for the fermenter. On the other hand, Plum is a mediocre source of Fruit Juice, but great for Mulch. The best seedoil nut is coconut, but butternut or hazelnut are good alternatives.\n\nWhen breeding these trees for quests, you will need to breed the species "pure", not a hybrid.

# Quest.1116 - Breed some cultivated bees
gtnh.quest1116.name=Breed some cultivated bees
gtnh.quest1116.desc=Common Princess and Foresty Drone can be bred to cultivated bees. \n\nCultivated bees have the shorest lifespan - this means they make great princesses to breed with your newly bred drones. The queen will die quickly, quickly giving genetic material to work with.  Make sure the traits you want are kept!\n\nThey are also a Fast production bee, which means lots of honey combs for powering your Beealyzer or Treealyzer. \n\nCultivated Bees produce Honey Combs every 0.9 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time.\n\nMake sure your cultivated bees are pure with a Beealyzer or GT scanner.\n\nThe main bee breeding quests will require pure bees but you can use Ignoble or Pristine princesses.

# Quest.1117 - Breed some common bees
gtnh.quest1117.name=Breed some common bees
gtnh.quest1117.desc=To cross breed bees you need two different species of bees. One drone and one princess from different hives (Meadows and Forestry as an example)\nBee Houses do not allow crossbreeding. In an Apiary you can cross breed them to a new species. Certain frames will help this process. Shortening their lifespan means faster crosses. Increasing Mutation rate means getting rare bees quicker.\n\nCommon Bees produce Honey Combs every 2.2 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time. \n\nMake sure your bees are pure by checking their genetics with a Beealyzer or GT scanner.

# Quest.1118 - Breed some noble bees
gtnh.quest1118.name=Breed some noble bees
gtnh.quest1118.desc=Cross breeding common and cultivated bees can result in noble bees. \n\nNoble bees produce dripping combs every 3.8 minutes and honeydew. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time. \n\nYou've heard of a drunk beekeeper saying he has perfected a method of creating proven frames using Honeydew and a little magic. It might be worth your time to try experimenting yourself.

# Quest.1119 - Dripping Combs

This means lots of genetic material for the next generation to work with.\n\nMajestic bees produce dripping combs every 1.5 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time.

# Quest.1121 - Breed some imperial bees
gtnh.quest1121.name=Breed some imperial bees
gtnh.quest1121.desc=Cross breeding noble and majestic bees can result in imperial bees.\n\nThese bees produce a Regeneration buff in their active area.  You can probably find a use for this in case of...accidents.\n\nImperial bees produce dripping combs every 3.8 minutes and royal jelly every 5.1 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time. \n\nRoyal jelly is needed in making scented paneling for an Alveary - the third tier bee housing.\n\nYou can now start working towards the Master Registry in the To Grind, or Not to Grind tab.

# Quest.1122 - Royal Jelly
gtnh.quest1122.name=Royal Jelly
gtnh.quest1122.desc=Royal jelly is a honey bee secretion that is used in the nutrition of larvae, as well as adult queens. It is only produced by the imperial bee. It's production can be increased with proven frames or any other kind of frames except for the soul frame. Royal jelly is also useful because it can craft ambrosia, which fills 8 hunger points (4 full food icons) and gives Regeneration I for 40 seconds. Royal jelly is used to craft scented paneling which are required in the creation of alveary blocks.

# Quest.1123 - Alvearies
gtnh.quest1123.name=Alvearies
gtnh.quest1123.desc=The alveary is an advanced variant of the apiary. The alveary allows for combs to be produced faster due to its natural speed increase to production (as well as the ability to add up to six frames via the Extra Bees frame housings) and due to its ability to be modified by other blocks. \nIt is possible to adjust the internal temperature of the alveary using the alveary heater or alveary fan in order to accommodate bees that require hotter or colder climates.\n It is also possible to use mutators to increase chances of mutation, alveary lighting and alveary rain shield to allow bees without the nocturnal and tolerant flyer traits to work during the night and rain, respectively, and the swarmer to use excess royal jelly to create princesses that last for a limited number of generations.\n\nA submission station is recommended for quests with large amounts of items.

gtnh.quest1132.desc=Your sword is too dull? Get some nether quartz to sharpen it again.\n\nIf you have lots of Certus quartz, 1 piece of Certus is equal to 24 Nether quartz.

# Quest.1133 - §3§lSubmission Station
gtnh.quest1133.name=§3§lSubmission Station
gtnh.quest1133.desc=Although many of the questing tasks can be submitted directly through your inventory (including liquids) sometimes you need a more automated solution. This is where the Object Submission Station (OSS) comes in handy. \nTasks supporting the OSS can be selected through the built in interface to enable its use. Once setup, liquids and items can be either piped in or dropped into the interface's input slot. It will not void items or liquids if no task is selected or if it has already been completed, however, making it relatively safe from accidental item/fluid deletion. Multiple OSS are also capable of taking on separate sub-tasks under the same quest simultaneously!

# Quest.1134 - §5§lLV Advanced Steam Boiler
gtnh.quest1134.name=§5§lLV Advanced Steam Boiler
gtnh.quest1134.desc=The LV Gt++ Steam Boiler is the next machine you can build to produce steam more efficiently than with the High Pressure Boiler.

# Quest.1135 - §5§lULV Transformer
gtnh.quest1135.name=§5§lULV Transformer
gtnh.quest1135.desc=To get your simple ore washer working you need a ULV Transformer. The Washer can only work with 8 EU. If you put more energy into it you get a big hole in your base.

gtnh.quest1136.name=§5§lLossless LV Cables
gtnh.quest1136.desc=How about losless 32 EU LV Cables ? Redstone alloy is a superconductor wire and will transfer your energy without any loss.\nRedalloy is a new alloy which requires an EBF. Mix redstone, silicon and coal by hand, or in the mixer for a better result.

# Quest.1137 - §9§lKinetic Power
gtnh.quest1137.name=§9§lKinetic Power
gtnh.quest1137.desc=The Kinetic Generator will transform mechanical energy into electricity. The EU output depends on the KU input. It is most commonly used together with a Kinetic Wind Generator, Kinetic Water Generator or a Kinetic Steam Generator.\n\nWhen placing a kinetic generator, any time, the "input" side is the side facing you.  So you will place the kinetic generator, then the wind/water/steam gen, and then place a rotor inside. Power can be drawn from any side of the kinetic generator, up to the rated amount per side. \n\nNOTE: It now requires an Avaritia Dire Crafting Table and Titanium. Follow the quests in Space Race and get to the moon. Use NEI to find the recipe since Better Questing cannot show it.\n\nWARNING: Breaking a kinetic generator improperly will not return the generator.  Use a GT wrench, and right-CLICK it.  It should drop immediately.  Try again if it just changed directions. 

# Quest.1138 - §9§lKinetic Wind Power
gtnh.quest1138.name=§9§lKinetic Wind Power
gtnh.quest1138.desc=The Kinetic Wind Generator generates energy from wind power which varies randomly, although certain factors can change this. \nUnlike the Windmill, the Kinetic Wind Generator will require maintenance in the form of the Rotors. These are needed to run the Kinetic Wind Generator.\nOnce a Rotor is placed inside the GUI, the block is given sufficient space, and the current wind level is adequate for the current rotor, the Kinetic Wind Generator will begin to generate Kinetic Energy. \nThis can be converted into EU by using a Kinetic Generator attached to the correct face (the black circle).\nAbout Wind\nFirst off, the wind strength of a particular area is affected by 3 factors: Height, Weather, and Chance. The higher up in the world you are, the higher the wind level. Below y64, there is never enough wind to be used, and KWG's will not function at all. Weather will also give boosts; Rainy weather will give a 20% boost to normal wind levels, and stormy weather will give a 50% boost. The final factor of chance makes the wind strength vary randomly, however there is a limited range of variation.\nThe easiest way to check the current wind level in an area is by using a Windmeter.\nWind is strongest at around Y160, towards the build limit of Y255 there is very little wind, hence no point attempting to run Windmills that high.\nWhile inconvenient, the Wind Generator can run anywhere.\n\nYou will need to use NEI to see the recipe, since it use the Dire Crafting table. Make sure to put the items in the right place, or you will get a Water Generator instead.

# Quest.1139 - §9§lKinetic Water Power
gtnh.quest1139.name=§9§lKinetic Water Power
gtnh.quest1139.desc=The Kinetic Water Generator allows Kinetic Units to be produced via the movement of water in river and ocean biomes. As with the Kinetic Wind Generator, it requires either Gearbox Rotor. Search NEI for appropriate options.\n\nIf the Kinetic Water Generator's Rotor isn't entirely submerged in water, it will alert you there is "no room for the rotor". If the Kinetic Water Generator isn't placed in a river, ocean or deep ocean biome, it will alert you it "must be placed in a river or ocean biome". Check the Game Mechanics spreadsheet on Discord for a list of biomes and their tags.\n\nWhile inconvenient, the Water Generator runs more consistently.\n\nYou will need to use NEI to see the recipe, since it use the Dire Crafting table. Make sure to put the items in the right place, or you will get a Wind Generator instead.\n\n§4You can use Witchery to convert biomes.

# Quest.1140 - §c§9§lRotor
gtnh.quest1140.name=§c§9§lRotor
gtnh.quest1140.desc=The Kinetic Wind and Water Generators need Gearbox Rotors to function.  They can be added and removed with standard automation. Higher tier rotors will last longer.

# Quest.1141 - §9§lWind Meter
gtnh.quest1141.name=§9§lWind Meter
gtnh.quest1141.desc=The Windmeter measures wind strength. It show's you on which height you can place your Wind Generator.

# Quest.1142 - §9§lHV Battery Buffers
gtnh.quest1142.name=§9§lHV Battery Buffers
gtnh.quest1142.desc=HV machines need battery buffers too. They come in different sizes like 1x, 4x, 9x and 16x.\nBuild a 1x and a 4x buffer for HV.  \n\nYou can use the 1x with a transformer and run MV machines for a decent time.  Or transform it twice  to LV and run a bunch of LV machines for a long time. Useful when you want scanner near your bees or trees. Remember to cover them up or else rain will make you very unhappy.

# Quest.1143 - §9§lHV Batteries
gtnh.quest1143.name=§9§lHV Batteries
gtnh.quest1143.desc=Better machines need some better batteries. Let's make some HV battery hulls for new batteries. Now it's up to you to make lithium, cadmium, sodium or acid batteries with these hulls.

# Quest.1144 - §9§lHV Lithium Battery
gtnh.quest1144.name=§9§lHV Lithium Battery
gtnh.quest1144.desc=Better machines need some better batteries. Lithium is the best material to use when making batteries. Make sure to use the Assembler recipe with Polyethylene to save on resources.

# Quest.1145 - §9§lHV EV Tranformer
gtnh.quest1145.name=§9§lHV EV Tranformer
gtnh.quest1145.desc=Gregtech cables will not connect to IC2 machines so you need transformers to convert the energy. The best way is building two transformers and a battery buffer to store the generated energy in batteries or energy cells. The longer the cable the more energy will be lost at low tiers. So use high tier voltages when transporting energy over long distances.\n\nBe careful; IC2 machines do not care about rain but your GT machines will explode violently if exposed to water.\n\nIt is also important to transfer the power up, not down, to avoid explosions if the rotor generates more than 120 EU/t. It is not recommenend to use better rotors than the iron ones on HV tier.

# Quest.1146 - §2§lGT 6 styled Pipes
gtnh.quest1146.name=§2§lGT 6 styled Pipes
gtnh.quest1146.desc=Maybe you are wondering why the new pipes don't auto-connect anymore? This was changed to make the pipe smarter. You can now use a wrench to connect only the pipes you want. You don't need a plate or a foil to prevent pipes from connecting anymore.\n\nYou'll still want to cover hot pipes to prevent getting hurt!\n\nShift clicking on the end of a pipe will disable the fluid input on that side. This is super handy, for example, to prevent coal boilers from feeding back steam into water pipes. \n\nAlso, pipes now come with a shutter built in for free to reduce sloshing. Shift-rightclick with a wrench on the side you want prevent input.\n\nLarge or Huge fluid pipes can be a "poor man's" storage tank, holding large amounts on their own.\n\nFor machine outputs, including the boilers, and water siding tanks you will not need pumps. Other tanks will need pumps or Tinker's Construct faucets to move fluids.\n\n§4Hint: If you click one pipe onto the other they will auto-connect.

# Quest.1147 - §3§2§4§3§lGT 6 styled Wires and Cables
gtnh.quest1147.name=§3§2§4§3§lGT 6 styled Wires and Cables
gtnh.quest1147.desc=Maybe you are wondering why the new wires and cables don't auto-connect anymore? This was changed to make the wires and cables smarter. You have to use a wirecutter or soldering iron to connect the wires and cables on the side you want. No more burnt cables or wrongly connected wires and cables from now on. You can shift-rightclick to attach a cable on the side of a machine you cannot see, like attaching a cable to the bottom while looking at the front.\n\nHint: If you click one wire or cable on the other it will auto-connect. Cables and pipes can be painted to make sure you do not cross your MV line with your EV line, or dump hot lava into your plastic water pipes. No boom today.\n\nHa ha just kidding there is always a boom today!

# Quest.1148 - §6§lMV Machine hull
gtnh.quest1148.name=§6§lMV Machine hull

gtnh.quest1153.name=§5§lArdite Crossbow Body
gtnh.quest1153.desc=To make your crossbow even better craft an ardite crossbow body. You received a few ardite ingots as reward before but will need to find ore in the Nether and process it in an Electric Blast Furnace.\nWith redstone you can make your bow faster. This requires a free modifier slot on your crossbow.\nDon't bother putting Nether Quartz on the crossbow, it only improves damage from whacking mobs over the head with it.  Put the Nether Quartz on your bolts instead.

# Quest.1154 - §5§lMagnalium Crossbow Bolts
gtnh.quest1154.name=§5§lMagnalium Crossbow Bolts
gtnh.quest1154.desc=Magnalium bolts are much better than your old wooden bolts.\nYou can use nether quartz on the bolts to make them even better. \nThis requires a free modifier slot.\nNOTE: Unlike other tinker tools and weapons, bolts cannot be upgraded.  You will need to make a fresh one. Experiment with NEI to find other good bolt materials. \n\n§4To make it, you must use a Fluid Solidifer instead of the Tinker's casting table.

# Quest.1212 - §d§lStarting Fusion
gtnh.quest1212.name=§d§lStarting Fusion
gtnh.quest1212.desc=Now that your power needs are increasing, you need a way to keep up with demand. To generate over 1A ZPM with a single machine you have two options: solars, and fusion. While solars are simpler to set up, solars cap out at 524288eu/t. Fusion can reach levels close to eight times that with the right setup. For your first reactor, you will need a controller, 2-16 fluid input hatches, 1-16 fluid output hatches, and 16 energy hatches. All hatches have to be LuV tier or better. Each hatch provides 2048eu/t for the recipe, and has a storage capacity of 160M eu. This means you can do any fusion recipe that takes less than 32768eu/t or less, and has a startup of 160M eu or less. Using more fluid hatches means you need less fusion casings. While this doesn't matter as much for the mk1 reactor, this principle helps tremendously with the high reactor tiers.

# Quest.1412 - §6§lAssembling Line
gtnh.quest1412.name=§6§lAssembling Line
gtnh.quest1412.desc=The assembling line (short form 'Ass Line') is a multiblock and important for high tier Components in LuV tier and above for Motors, Pistons, Robot Arms, Pumps and many more.\n\nThe machine can be 5-16 blocks long. The minimum length required depends on the number of components and fluids required by the recipe it's crafting. A length of 11 blocks will fit 80 percent of all recipes in GTNH.\nThe bottom layer must have on one outer side all the Input Hatches for fluids (4), in the bottom middle layer Input Busses for items(10), and on the end 1 Output Bus. Also on the bottom outer layer must be one Maintainance Hatch. The rest is Solid Steel Machine Casings.\n\nThe second layer on the outer sides left and right are Reinforced Glass and in the middle center Assembling Line Casing.\n\nThe third layer has on the left and right Grate Machine Casings and in the middle Assembler Machine Casings (Note the name change!). The Assembling Line control block and Data Access Hatch are on the opposite edge from the Input Hatches - not at the end with the Output Bus.\n\nThe fourth layer is a single line of Solid Steel Machine Casings in the middle(11), with two Energy Hatches for power. Once you have it built, you can replace the two IV energy hatches with 1 LuV energy hatch.\n\nAutomating the assline is God tier GTNH endgame. While it can be done with Enderio, it's easier to use SFM or OpenComputers.\n\nFor more details on using the Assembly Line, check out the wiki page https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-Assline

gtnh.quest1462.desc=Thermal Padding is a suite of garments made out of an advanced insulating material. The garments are able to keep a player from freezing to death in the cold environments of Outer Space. They are also able to keep the player from suffering heat exhaustion in an overly hot environment.\n\nThe temperature indicator on the Life Support HUD will show if the player is becoming too hot or too cold - as the temperature approaches dangerous levels, an "Invalid Thermal Protection" warning will be shown. On Mars and the Asteroids, simply wearing a full set of Thermal Padding should be enough to fix this.

# Quest.1463 - Sleeping in Space
gtnh.quest1463.name=Sleeping in Space

Not only does its light prevent mobs from spawning nearby, but it is so bright that if a mob comes close to the Arc Lamp the mob will turn around and walk away again. This mob repellant effect is confirmed to work on : Zombies, Skeletons, Creepers, Evolved Zombies, Evolved Skeletons, Evolved Creepers. It may also work on other types of mobs (confirmation required). But it has no effect on Spiders (they are not afraid of sunlight either) or boss mobs.

# Quest.1465 - Air Lock

gtnh.quest1466.desc=Ambient Thermal Controller is an item for use in the Oxygen Sealer to provide thermal protection in sealed spaces.\n\nAmbient Thermal Controller is useful in the dimensions too cold or too hot for players to survive without Thermal Padding.\n\nIt can be placed in the 3rd slot next to the energy and oxygen slots in a working Oxygen Sealer. Once the Ambient Thermal Controller is in the sealer, it will heat or cool the output oxygen according to the local environment, and then the player can safely take the thermal padding off in the sealed room.

# Quest.1467 - Oxygen Sealer
gtnh.quest1467.name=Oxygen Sealer
gtnh.quest1467.desc=The Oxygen Sealer is a machine that fills a room with oxygen (although the oxygen is generally not visible) up to around 800-1000 blocks (amount stacks with multiple sealers within close proximity) allowing the user to breathe without Oxygen Gear. Unlike the Oxygen Bubble Distributor, the Oxygen Sealer confines the oxygen to the room it is in. The sealer must be supplied with power and sufficient oxygen. See Oxygen Collector for supplying oxygen.\n\nThe sealer will only work in a room that is completely sealed off from outer space. This can be achieved with either a completely closed off room, or with an Air Lock. The sealer must have nothing above it to block its vents. It is designed to check for a proper seal about every 5 seconds, so be sure to give it time to seal.\n\nEach sealer requires at least 320 air points per second to work continuously or it will fail.

# Quest.1468 - Large Oxygen Tanks

# Quest.1470 - Cavernous Vine
gtnh.quest1470.name=Cavernous Vine
gtnh.quest1470.desc=Cavernous Vine is a poisonous plant that grows naturally in the Mars underground. It grows from the ceiling down to the floor in the huge caves flooded with Bacterial Sludge, emits light and can trap mobs in it.\n\nAny mob that touches this plant will be poisoned, dragged up and lose health down to 1 health point (half a heart) while trapped in this plant. Mobs that are immune to poison, like Zombies and Skeletons, will not lose health.\n\nThey grow from the bottom face of a solid block down to 1 block away from the floor.\n\nCavernous vines can be broken by hand without taking damage or being poisoned but they will drop nothing. They can be obtained as an item using shears. Even picks with Silk Touch enchant will not obtain anything.\n\nOnce obtained, they can be replanted elsewhere and regrow, like cactus.

# Quest.1471 - Slimeling

They can also have a neutral behavior, that is, they can attack if provoked or hurt by non-owners.\n\nItems that you can feed Slimelings with:\n\nBoat\nCooked fish\nGunpowder\nGold ingot\nRedstone repeater\nWooden door\n\nSlimelings can be equipped by their owners with a Slimeling Inventory Bag to transport items.

# Quest.1472 - Grapple
gtnh.quest1472.name=Grapple
gtnh.quest1472.desc=The Grapple is a grappling hook and rope which can be thrown by a player, and then used to swing the player in the direction it was thrown. Useful for reaching places that are otherwise too high to jump to, or traveling around the Asteroids.\n\nRight-click to aim the Grapple at a block you want to reach, similar to aiming a Bow. Release the right-click - similar to firing an arrow from a bow - to grapple yourself in that direction.\n\nFor best results, aim the Grapple at a point 1 or 2 blocks higher than the point you want to reach.\nIf there is no safe platform to land at that point, you can fall back down and you will take fall damage, so it takes some skill to use the Grapple safely.\nTake care using the Grapple near a Nether Portal, End Portal or at a low height (less than y = 30) on a Space Station. There can be strange consequences if it crosses into another dimension.

gtnh.quest1482.desc=Now that you have some tech, you've discovered a way to prospect for ores. This tool only has a chance at finding the ores in a chunk. If you are clever, you can use it to locate ores.\n\nUnfortunately, the tech to make it repairable or rechargeable doesn't work yet, so you'll have to make a new one each time it breaks. It does work better at higher tiers and lasts longer with better materials.\n\nAnd since it doesn't make a convenient book like the seismic prospector, you'll have to keep track on your own where the ores are found.\n\nIt can be hard to choose a good material for the Basic Prospector. Here are some good choices for you, the size searched, and their durability:\n\nArdite 5x5 - 4500\nDamascus 3x3 - 5600\nVanadiumsteel 3x3 - 8400\nVibrant Alloy 5x5 - 17700\nShadow 5x5 - 36000\n\nEach chunk successfully scanned costs 100 durability. Each failed chunk costs 25. The average for MV is ~55 per chunk when scanning a large area.\n\nGood luck.

# Quest.1496 - §2§lHow the heck do I find ores?
gtnh.quest1496.name=§2§lHow the heck do I find ores?
gtnh.quest1496.desc=TL;RD - Go install InGameInfoXML from https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-IGIX\n\nGregTech ore generation is based on veins. Veins are centered on orecenters, based on the chunk number. To find the chunk number, hit F3. In the X and Z lines you will see numbers like\nc: 3 (14)\nc: -2 (1)\n\nThe 3,-2 is the chunk's address. Ignore the negative sign.  Now, the orecenters are located at 3N+1 chunks.  So, 4,7 is an orecenter. 10,16. -22,19.  Etc. \n\nProtip: to find out if a number is divisible by 3, add the digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3.  So 86 = 8+6 = 14. So you need to go down 1 chunk or up 2 chunks so that you are on a 3N+1 chunk.\n\nFor reading all the way, I'll give you an ingot of iron.

You will see the durability bar change when it discovers a match. Watch out - it will respond to small ores as well as normal ores so Lapis and Redstone you will want to wait for large signal before digging. If it detects a large quantity of the ore you're looking for the wand will flip upside down completely and fill the durability bar. If you play with your sound on you will hear an obvious sound to notify you as well. The wand works in both your inventory and hotbar and you don't need to be actively holding it, though you get style points if you are holding it.\n\n§4Also, because of the magical nature of the wand, the ore is stored with the player, not the wand. If you want to give the wand to someone else, please remove the ore first.

# Quest.1541 - Analyze your crops
gtnh.quest1541.name=Analyze your crops
gtnh.quest1541.desc=The cropnalyzer is a powered tool used to analyze IC2 crop seedbags. Charge it by placing it in an MV machine; recommended to put an MV battery in it as well to keep it full. To fully analyze a seed bag, you will need to put it through the cropnalyzer four times. If the crop is already planted, it is better to analyze it with the portable scanner instead of breaking it just to scan it - you have a chance of losing the seed every time you break it.\n\nThe cropnalyzer also has a feature called the IC2 Crop Calculator, where you can find the mix of outputs of breeding together any crops. To access the calculator, hit the IC2 side inventory key while holding the cropnalyzer.  You can select any crop available and discover which crossbreeds have high chances.\n\nYou can choose up to four crops to breed together. Then click "process" and the bottom row will show the possible crossbreeding outputs, and their weights. You can use the + and - gui buttons to scroll through the row(s) of crops. You can also use a button in the GUI to sort the rows by tier or weight. You can invert the sorting by hitting the sorting button while holding shift.\n\nWhen trying to get a specific crop, you generally want to maximize its weight. But more specifically, you want to maximize the proportion of its weight out of all the weights. To determine the best crops to breed, look at their attributes.  Parent crops that share more attributes with a crossbreed increase its chances. This means there are no benefits to breeding 3 or 4 identical crops together instead of 2, since all weights are increased evenly.  \n\nUse the crops guide at https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-Crops for more details.\n\nTry a variety of combinations to get the crops you want. Often, breeding together two of the same crop is a surprisingly good option or even the best one.  A large field of stickreeds has a good chance at making lots of valuable crosses.

# Quest.1542 - Crop automation
gtnh.quest1542.name=Crop automation
gtnh.quest1542.desc=The Crop-Matron is a LV machine that will monitor crops in a 9x9x3 area and automatically apply fertilizer, Weed-EX, and Water as needed. Water can be pumped in directly or use IC2 Universal water cells, normal cells aren't returned when they are used.\n\nThe Crop-Matron is rainproof, but make sure you cover up your power supply (you might find a fancy way to do this), or use an LV battery.  A Lithium Ion will last about 2 hours.\n\nUse Weed-EX sparingly, since overuse will affect crops negatively. \n\nTilled dirt still requires a nearby water block to be hydrated as the Matron will only water the crop, not the soil. Try putting a lily pad on top so it isn't annoying to walk on, or using Garden Soil instead.\n\nYou'll need Stainless Steel to make the Crop Harvester.\n\nAs an alternative to the Crop Matron and Crop Harvester, you can make the Forestry Multifarm. It can also pick crops from cropsticks.

# Quest.1543 - Weed Ex

This is only partially true. A fully grown Mandrake may scream causing immense discomfort to those around. This is why it is best to harvest the Mandrake root at night when the plant is more likely to be dormant. Mandrake is grown from Mandrake Seeds which may be obtained by breaking tall grass, or by breaking a partially (or fully) grown Mandrake plant.\n\nBreaking a fully grown Mandrake plant will either yield Mandrake Root or the Mandrake may awaken and cause all sorts of mischief (and pain to the ears!).\n\nBelladonna seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage belladonna plant.

# Quest.1624 - Junctions
gtnh.quest1624.name=Junctions
gtnh.quest1624.desc=So how do we deal with junctions then? We use these pipes. They are smart and they will send everything where it needs to go, so if you make a junction make sure you put this pipe there.

# Quest.1625 - Interacting with stuff
gtnh.quest1625.name=Interacting with stuff
gtnh.quest1625.desc=That's all nice and all, but none of these pipes connect to chests and machines. What am I supposed to do with them?\n\nI'm glad you asked. You are going to need a special pipe for that. This is a pipe you need to use to connect to machines and chests. You'll have to set it up with chips that we'll make soon.

# Quest.1626 - Chips
gtnh.quest1626.name=Chips
gtnh.quest1626.desc=Now you need to make some chips to use in those interface pipes. These ones do not do anything but are needed as a material for crafting the others.\n\nNow would be a good time to look into IC2 crops to get all the dyes you will need for your advanced chips.

# Quest.1627 - Item responder chip
gtnh.quest1627.name=Item responder chip
gtnh.quest1627.desc=This chip also stores items in connected invetory. It designates a storage for items that are set in the filter of this chip. They do not actively request for items they only serve as a destination for items to go. You can open up the menu by rightclicking the chip. There you can set which items should it accept and the priority. Items will go to item responders with higher priority first.

# Quest.1628 - Item overflow chip
gtnh.quest1628.name=Item overflow chip
gtnh.quest1628.desc=This chip stores the items in connecting inventory. It designates a storage for items that have no other place to go. It is strongly recomended to have a default storage for items in every pipe system, otherwise bad stuff can happen. Best used with some large chest (diamond one for example).\n\nIt seems to have some bugs though, so don't craft more than one without testing it first.\n\nYou might have to just use a normal item responder and add the items you want routed back to you overflow spot.

# Quest.1629 - Dynamic item responder
gtnh.quest1629.name=Dynamic item responder
gtnh.quest1629.desc=Dynamic item responder chip behaves exatly like an item responder chip, but instead of you setting up which items it should accept, it looks in the chest what items are there and those items it will accept.

# Quest.1630 - Item extractor chip
gtnh.quest1630.name=Item extractor chip
gtnh.quest1630.desc=This chip will extract items from the connecting inventory. The extracted items then look for pipes with item responder chips where there's a free space they could go. If they don't find any they will go to the overflow default storage chest.\n\nIf you want it to extract everything leave the filter empty and set it to blacklist.

# Quest.1631 - Item broadcaster
gtnh.quest1631.name=Item broadcaster
gtnh.quest1631.desc=Item broadcaster is a chip that tells everyone in the pipe system what items it has in the connecting inventory and if anyone needs anything it will send it to them. Right click it to set the items it will transmit. If you leave it empty and set to blacklist it will transmit everything.\n\nDefinitely use one in combination with an item overflow chip on your default storage chest. That way overflow will end up in the chest, but will be useable by the rest of your system.

# Quest.1632 - Item stock keeper chip
gtnh.quest1632.name=Item stock keeper chip
gtnh.quest1632.desc=Item stock keeper looks at the connecting inventory and keeps item stocked in there. If the item is missing it will keep bothering item broadcasters every few seconds if they have the item and if they can send it. It's basically like an annoying child. \n\nIt is really useful though. Want a chest that will always have 64 cobble and dirt in it and if you take them they will get replaced? This guy is perfect for that job. It's great for keeping  machines stocked. When stocking GT machines, the top left slot of the 3x3 is equal to the left slot of the machine.  Want a chemical reactor that keeps 3 hydrogen cells ready to go to make ammonia, just add nitrogen?  This is the chip for you.

# Quest.1633 - Crafting chip

# Quest.1638 - Electrolyzing water
gtnh.quest1638.name=Electrolyzing water
gtnh.quest1638.desc=Now let's automate electrolyzing water into oxygen and hydrogen. You'll need hydrogen for tons of stuff including desulfurization, obtaining tungsten, and nitric acid production. Oxygen is also useful as I'm sure you noticed when making steel.\n\nHow to set it up:\n\nPlace the electrolyzer down and connect it to water and electricity. Place the 2 super tanks nearby. Set the electrolyzer to produce hydrogen gas and oxygen cells. Use normal GT fluid pipes to output the hydrogen gas into one super tank. That is now your hydrogen storage. Now connect interface pipes to all 3 machines.\n\nFor the electrolyzer put in item stock keeper set to keep 2 empty cells stored. Also put in extractor set to extract oxygen cells.\n\nNow for the oxygen storage put it item responder chip set to accept oxygen cells and extractor set to extract empty cells.\n\nNow put some empty cells inside your default storage chest and don't forget to have a broadcaster there.

# Quest.1639 - Desulfuring the oil
gtnh.quest1639.name=Desulfuring the oil
gtnh.quest1639.desc=Now it's time to start the actual desulfurization. Use a chemical reactor of your choice, fill it with sulfuric light fuel and hook it to power. Now connect an interface pipe to it. Put an item stock keeper inside set to store 4 hydrogen cells. Then put in item extractor set to extract Hydrogen sulfide and empty cell.\n\nGo to your hydrogen storage super tank and put in a crafting chip set to make one hydrogen cell from one empty cell.\n\nAnd that's all.

# Quest.1640 - Dealing with H2S
gtnh.quest1640.name=Dealing with H2S
gtnh.quest1640.desc=Now let's convert all that H2S into sulfuric acid. Hook up a chemical reactor to electricity, water and interface pipe. Put inside an item responder chip set to accept H2S cells and extract empty cells. Distill that diluted sulfuric acid in distillery and store it in super tank.\n\nCongratulations. You now have a completely automatic desulfuring of oil, automatic production of hydrogen and oxygen and you also store all that sulfuric acid.

# Quest.1641 - Small reward

Use a machine controller cover on the controller (protip: You can put it on the bottom, or on the side next to a casing, casings will transmit redstone signal). \nWith a machine controller cover, you can use redstone to turn the machine on and off. This is handy if you don't want to use a soft hammer to disable a machine.\n \nThe best way to do that is with an RS latch. One input will turn the machine on, and one input will turn the machine off.\nUse a comparator attached to a valve to measure the steam level in your multiblock Iron or Steel Tank. Invert the signal to turn on your boiler when the steam level is low. When the steam level signal is high, turn your boiler off. Use a trail of redstone to lower the signal strength. Because of boiler/turbine warmup, try to set the ON strength to 30 percent of capacity and OFF strength to about 90 percent.\n\nRed alloy wire will hold a redstone signal for a longer distance.\n\nYou can use a Energy Detector Cover in Normal Electrical Storage (including batteries) mode to monitor the power in a battery buffer and use it to enable/disable generators in a similar way. Change mode using a screwdriver.

gtnh.quest1754.desc=100 Percent Waterproof.\n\n\nThe computer base is the HUB of all your computer parts essentially.\nIt takes two memory sticks, a BIOs rom, a CPU, and a hard drive at the very least to run your computer.\n\nThe power converter allows you to power it from your GregTech power grid, and the floppy drive will allow you to install your operating system onto the hard drive.   Both parts are essential but both for some strange reason requires the T2 microchips to craft; so here's a starting pair using T1 Microchips instead- Don't lose them!

# Quest.1755 - My Little Scrench

# Quest.1759 - Tier 1
gtnh.quest1759.name=Tier 1
gtnh.quest1759.desc=Congratulations we have the parts to start making a computer!\n\nLet's start with the basics here.

gtnh.quest1760.desc=This block allows our computer to interact with GT machines and everything else.  A must have!

# Quest.1761 - Hello World!
gtnh.quest1761.name=Hello World!
gtnh.quest1761.desc=First things first,  let's install OpenOS to the computer so you don't always need disk in the drive.  Type in 'install' and then type 'Y' when asked if you wish to install OpenOS.     \nWhen finished, remove the disk and toss it on your wall and reboot the computer. \nType 'df' to display all present file systems and mount points, you'll notice one named OpenOS; this is your hard drives default name after installing the OS.  \nLet's change it with 'label set -a OpenOS HDD'   -a checks for names starting with what you type after it with that command.\n\nNow for fun, let's make your first program!   How about something functional,  make a with 'edit startup'  this will bring you to an edit page for a new program called startup.      Let's just have it do something simple,  'print("Hello World!")'  Like that'll never get old.\n\nNow press Ctrl+S to save, and Ctrl+W to get out of that screen.   Back in your home root let's now type startup and you'll see it display "Hello World!"  neat huh?\n\nLet's now make startup actually work on startup.  Type 'edit .shrc' .shrc is a mystic file that runs shell commands when booting your PC.  So in .shrc type 'startup'   save and reboot the computer.  Now it should say "Hello World!" upon starting.   Double neat right?

# Quest.1762 - I love pressing the F5 key.
gtnh.quest1762.name=I love pressing the F5 key.
gtnh.quest1762.desc=It's so refreshing.\n\nPlace a keyboard facing a screen- or stuck to the back of a screen to make it able to interact with a computer.\nAbsolutely necessary to doing anything on your computer, but can safely be removed once you have an endlessly running program.

# Quest.1763 - Mounting your HDD
gtnh.quest1763.name=Mounting your HDD
gtnh.quest1763.desc=Alright,  you have your computer, it says "Hello World!" When you start it, and you feel awesome and capable of world domination. \n\nNow lets setup your HDD.    Open .shrc again in the editor, and press ENTER to go down a line after the print, and type in 'cd ../'  this will move your viewed directory that's being viewed to-  well, the absolute base directory.  \n\nNow go down another line and type in 'mount HDD C:'  because why not, it's Classic; this mounts the file drive into the folder you're in.   Go down another line and type cd 'C:/'   save and reboot the computer.\n\nYou'll now start in C:/  nifty!  Try typing 'mkdir programs' and now you have a dedicated directory to put your programs in for the sake of organization.\n'cd programs' will then take you to programs, and 'cd ../' will take you back a directory; you can also do things like- lets say you have a folder called apples in C as well but you're in apples, type 'cd ../apples' and it'll take you to apples,  .. essentially just means previous directory and this can be stacked; works with copying files and moving them as well, very useful to know.  \n\nut right now we're going to do something functional,  come over to the next quest and bring your adapter and cables.

# Quest.1764 - Basic Power Display
gtnh.quest1764.name=Basic Power Display
gtnh.quest1764.desc=For this part we will learn how to use our adapter,  place it next to- let's say your EBFs battery buffer and connect it to the computer with cables.\nNow lets type in lua while on the computer to open the LUA environment where we can test things without worrying about saving and trying our program.\n\nType in 'component.list()'   this will display a table of all of .list from component.  What we're looking for is gt_batterybuffer.\nIf you have too many nearby things it may not display and the way to search the entire list of components is too advanced for starters.\n\nSo now assign a variable to it; for example 'a = component.gt_batterybuffer';  now we can call 'a' to see what methods the batteryBuffer has.\nWhat we'll be using in this example is the 'getBatteryCharge' method.  So type\n 'a.getBatteryCharge(1)' this will call the method getBatteryCharge from the first inventory slot on the gt_batterybuffer in component.\n\n So if we're using a 2x2 battery buffer; we can type something like- 'for i=1, 4 do print(a.getBatteryCharge(i)) end\nPoof you now see what all the batteries EU values.  Now what can we do with this?\n\nTry making a variable called 'batteryCharge = 0',  now do 'for i=1, 4 do batteryCharge = batteryCharge + a.getBatteryCharge(i) end'\n\nNow print(batteryCharge) will display the total charge. Here's a program example of this being used.\n\nPlace in your tape drive and type 'install', and follow the promps to install it into C.  Then edit it, test it, figure how it works.\n\nI suppose that's enough for now; congrats!  Experiment and learn, and don't forget to check google as much as possible!  \nThis questline will be updated again in the future; but I figure this is a good ending point for now.

Pollution is nobody's friend!\n\nDuring setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow.  Sometimes things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light orb!\n\nMake sure your muffler faces *out*, not *in*. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!\n\nWhen placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF.  Especially at LV, those few meters make a big difference!  Every amp of energy travelling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get!\n\nOutput hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them.  They will also void if they are full, so keep an eye on them!\n\nWhen build multiple EBFs, the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share walls. This can save you on input and output hatches too.  Not recommended for energy and maintenance hatches!

# Quest.1894 - §6§lGas Turbine
gtnh.quest1894.name=§6§lGas Turbine
gtnh.quest1894.desc=A Large Gas Turbine is more fuel-efficient than singleblock turbines and can have lower pollution with upgraded mufflers.\n\nYou will also need a muffler, maintenance hatch, input hatch, and dynamo hatch.  Don't forget a fluid regulator. It can be a low tier fluid regulator since the fluid/tick necessary is much less than steam.\n\nSelecting a rotor is pretty easy. Take the EU/t of your dynamo hatch, and select a rotor that has (optimal gas flow * efficiency) that is close. Now, setting up the fluid regulator is hard. The easiest way is to let in 1 L/t and use the hand-scanner to tell you the optimal flow rate. Otherwise divide the optimal gas flow by the EU/L of your gas and round down. \n\nFor example, if we are using a normal vibrant alloy turbine with 1800 EU/t optimal gas flow and 115 percent efficiency with benzene. \n1800/288 = 6.25\nRounded down that is 6L/t.  6 * 288 * 1.15 = 1987, perfect for an EV dynamo.\nOther gases may output slightly higher or lower EU depending on how close to optimal they can reach. For example refinery gas\n1800/160 = 11.25\n11 * 160 * 1.15 = 2024, still OK for an EV dynamo\nHowever hydrogen at 20 EU/L is dangerous because\n1800/20 = 90\n90 * 20 * 1.15 = 2070, above 2048, so BOOOOM.  You'll have to use a multi-amp dynamo hatch to prevent an explosion.\n\nOther useful turbine options at EV are normal ardite and galgadorian.\n\nFor additional choices, see the Large Turbine Calculator in Discord.

While AE2 can handle simple crafting up to 9 components at a time and even nesting ingredients, SFM can handle the complex crafting required for the assline.\n\nInventory Cables connect the MIM to inventories or tanks.\n\nRight now until some Moron figures it out, your best bet is to experiment, ask for help on Discord, and search Google. The interface resembles most GUI based automation systems like LabView.\n\nThere have been TPS problems caused by poorly designed SFM setups.  Make sure your outputs are properly emptied, and don't get filled.\n\nInventory cables are the "basic" cable of SFM. They allow the MIM to interact with an inventory, and act as a connector cable to other cables.\n\nmehdi2344 thinks my jokes suck, but he's an idiot, so there. \n\nThanks to Nori Silverrage for writing up these quests!

However, learning TecTech is incredibly confusing, so listen very carefully. \n\nFirst, you'll need to gather various casings for your machines that you'll need. High Power Casings, Computer Casings, and Computer Vents will do, though you'll require a large amount of them before proceeding onward.

# Quest.2007 - Quantum Computer
gtnh.quest2007.name=Quantum Computer
gtnh.quest2007.desc=One of the more incredibly complicated machines, this will serve as the main structure for your "Computation" generation for the giant Research Station. First, you'll need a few things, the Quantum Computer itself, a huge energy hatch several amps of UV or above, this is because as Computer Racks, that'll be explained later on down here, will continuously increase the demand of energy input for every new Computer Rack that you add on. The Multiblock also consumes a large amount of energy by itself. Another important factor is ONLY turn on the Quantum Computer once you have the desired recipes for the Research Station ready to avoid excess energy loss. In order for you to build this absolute monster, you'll need to place down the Quantum Computer at least 1 block above the surface/ground and use the Multiblock Machine Blueprint, this will give you a hefty amount of information and various ghost-like blocks that'll show where casings and or hatches should go.\n\nComputation:\nComputation is generated every second and is based on the tier of your circuit. There are, however, differences in between how much computation is generated, even with the same exact tier. For instance, you could use a Master Quantum Computer (Quantum Circuit Series / LuV) or a Wetwareprocessor (Wetware Circuit Series / LuV) which will give you more Computation even though they are of the same tier. If you wish to find out exactly how much Computation a circuit gives; place down a Computer Rack, put a circuit inside and scan it. It will include the following information\nBase computation: \nAfter overclocking: <numbers, same as above unless you specially overclock it>\nHeat Accumulated: <numbers, based on circuits and heat vents, keep a watchful eye on this part as it's extremely important>\n\nComputer Racks:\nThe main component within the multiblock to generate Computation. In order to achieve this, you will need to input some circuits and heat vents; Advanced Heat Vents work best. It is critical that you use Heat Vents to prevent the heat from reaching a catastrophic point, 55 percent or above should be avoided for safety reasons. Technically, you could achieve "55 percent" in your Computer Racks, but in reality, they could explode around 4000-4999 heat. In order to precisely find out how much heat, you'll need a Parametrizer, which will be explained later. Now that you've understood one of the more basic concepts and safety of handling within the Computer Racks (scan the Racks before you run the Quantum Computer!), what are the more optimal setups for your Quantum Computer? Do keep in mind that even a 128 min Computation / Sec setup can complete practically 3/4th's of the recipes within the Research Station. In this case, a 4 Computer Rack setup with 1 Advanced Heat Vent and 3 Wetwareprocessors (LuV) will generate 72 Computation every second; leading up to a maximum of 288 Computation every second at just 5 amps of UV (524,288 EU/t) with only 4 Computer Racks required. This is a rather minimal setup compared to some of the more complicated setups.\n\nAnd most importantly: DO NOT WRENCH THE COMPUTER RACKS IF THEY HAVE HEAT IN THEM. Scan them before anything else! Otherwise, you're going to get an explosion.\n\nUncertainty Resolver\nMuch like a puzzle-solving simulation, it is rather complicated to explain how to solve it, but it's often best just to retrace or undo certain actions and hope for the best. Sometimes, the Schr�dinger Status will require some puzzle solving again after a period of time. This is random and incredibly frustrating especially during operations being done between the Research Station and Quantum Computer(s), so it is important to constantly check the Uncertainty Resolver before you start operations on your Computer.\n\nNow that you understand some of this, it is time to build the Computer! You'll need to gather quite a lot of resources at first.

# Quest.2008 - Research Station
gtnh.quest2008.name=Research Station
gtnh.quest2008.desc=Now that you've started building up your precious Quantum Computer, how about the giant Research Station? Once again, using the Multiblock Machine Blueprint will tell you how to build this Multiblock. Once it is nearly assembled, place down an Energy Hatch, an Optical Slave Connector, and a Maintenance Hatch all on the back side. Once fully assembled, you can now begin operating recipes at any given time, so long as the Quantum Computer is also active. This Research Station requires you to put the desired item within the Object Holder, then a data stick in the Multiblock interface itself. Once the Computation is fully completed, the data stick that houses all the data of the completed item will be inside the Multiblock Interface. Still confused? Good, that's the spirit of learning! Always make sure to test these things in Single Player if you wish to find exact measurements and such. \n\nDon't forget to ALWAYS COLOR THE OPTICAL HATCHES AND FIBERS!

gtnh.quest2014.name=§6§lAll those chunks, all in a row
gtnh.quest2014.desc=Sometimes you don't want a 3x3 area chunkloaded, but a long straight line instead.  This can be handy for rail lines or power lines coming from long distances.  An anchor sentinel can perform this function.  Right-click on a chunk loader with a crowbar, and it will activate. Go in any straight line from the chunkloader and place the anchor and hit it with the crowbar. Those chunks, up to 25x1, will now remain loaded.\n\nThis will draw an amount of chunkloader time relative to the 9 chunk area normally loaded. If for some reason you wanted only a 1 chunk area loaded, this will extend the time. Stock up on those pearls or server coins!

# Quest.2019 - The Basics of SFM
gtnh.quest2019.name=The Basics of SFM
gtnh.quest2019.desc=Variables - Declaration vs Standard\nDeclaration is simply creating a variable with eligible blocks in it. This allows easy updating of workflows. For instance you could have a variable that contains 2 chests. You use it in a nifty for each loop and later add another chest. Simply update the variable and the for each loop will start using it.\n\nStandard variables are able to be inserted into the middle of a workflow (it has input/output) and thus can be modified on the run.\n\nPlease note that for each loops will require a empty variable to work with. This is listed as "Element" in the loop.\n\nGlobal vs Local\nGlobal will keep changes to a variable that are done in the workflow, whereas local keeps anything done local to that part of the workflow.

# Quest.2020 - A magical box
gtnh.quest2020.name=A magical box
gtnh.quest2020.desc=This magical box is amazing. No matter how many are created, they all seem to connect to the same dimension.  I can store items in one location, and pull them out somewhere else! I can use dyes on the top of the box to assign its location, and any box with the same colors will share the same space. Using a diamond on the box locks it my mind, and a private network.  Shift-rightclicking will remove the diamond and join the chest back to the public network.

# Quest.2021 - A magical tank
gtnh.quest2021.name=A magical tank
gtnh.quest2021.desc=This tank always seems to connect to the same dimensional space.  No matter how many I create.  I can push fluids into the tank in one dimension, and retrieve them in a totally different dimension! I have discovered a way to assign a location to each tank using dyes applied to the top.  Using a diamond makes the tank private, attuned to the caster's mind, and will not share fluids with any other player's tanks. Shift-rightclicking recovers the diamond and makes the tank part of the public tank network. The dial on front controls the input/output of the tank. When blue is up, the tank accepts fluids.  When orange is up, the tank will eject fluids. 

# Quest.2022 - That chest is too big to carry around

gtnh.quest2024.name=§c§lAssline quest updates
gtnh.quest2024.desc=When the pack updates, and changes an assembly line recipe, your old data sticks become useless. However it's more than that, you can't simply rescan an old UV motor for the new UHV data, you need a new UV motor. It's best to start with component parts in the lowest changed tier, then work your way up until you've rescanned up to your current tier. Yes, this sucks, we also wish there was another way. You can tell if your data stick is out of date by seeing if the nei recipe matches the one in the data viewer. Nei will always be right.

# Quest.2141 - §6§lWelcome to the Church of Benzene
gtnh.quest2141.name=§6§lWelcome to the Church of Benzene
gtnh.quest2141.desc=If you made it to MV using steam, you're probably wondering how to survive going further. One option is to switch to Light Fuel, discussed in LV.  Another option is to use Benzene. Benzene is made from Wood Tar. There are a couple of pathways for that. Both start with logs from trees.  \n\nOne path is to use Coke ovens or Advanced Coke Ovens to make charcoal, and fluid-extract Wood Tar from it (use LV fluid extractors for maximum EU efficiency). Then distill the Wood Tar to make Benzene. This method produces no pollution.\n\nThe second path is to use the Pyrolyze Oven multiblock and Nitrogen gas to extract Wood Tar and Charcoal. Fluid Extract the Charcoal for addtional Wood Tar.  Then proceed as above. This method will create pollution from the Pyrolyze, but will provide more Benzene per log.\n\nExcess wood tar can also be turned into Toluene, a key ingredient for explosives that you will need later on.

# Quest.2160 - Carpenter's Blocks
gtnh.quest2160.name=Carpenter's Blocks
gtnh.quest2160.desc=Yet another custom block system! Carpenter's blocks are crafted blank and placed in-world, and then plain block textures applied to them. The blocks must not be Tile Entities, so Botany blocks don't work correctly with them, but GT Stones like Red Granite, and any colored clay or vanilla glass block will work. Some Chisel glass types will work, and Ztones blocks and Tinted Glass also work.\n\nThe Garage Door requires a block at the top to hang "down" from, but can pretty much be any length.  A redstone signal on any block next to the Garage Door blocks will open or close the door. The open/close will propagate across multiple vertical doors, so you can setup non-square doors. Sneaking and right-clicking with an empty hand will change the door's polarity.\n\nThe pressure plates are player-only activation, making them great for doors into your base.\n\nThe hatches must be clicked on the side of a block to place. They can be handy for protecting you from crucible...byproducts.\n \nThere is a lot more block shapes possible, check NEI for "Carpenter's" to see the options.\n\nThe Chisel allows you to chisel blocks while attached to a Carpenter's block.\n\nThe Hammer allows various functions.\n\nHammer on door - changes door shape type\nSneak Hammer on door - Changes from iron to wooden behavior\nSneak Hammer on lever - Changes polarity (which direction is on/off)

# Quest.2161 - §3§lSafety first
gtnh.quest2161.name=§3§lSafety first
gtnh.quest2161.desc=For those new to GregTech, here are some tips and warnings about electricity. \n\nMachines don't like being out in the rain, and will start fires nearby.  Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending too high voltage to a machine will cause a near-instant explosion.\n\nSending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a wire does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.\n\nA generator that supplys 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than full voltage.  For example, macerators doing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run 4 or 5 off of a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.\n\nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.

# Quest.2209 - Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees
gtnh.quest2209.name=Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees
gtnh.quest2209.desc=First off, don't be scared by the massive amounts of bees you see here once you unlock the breeding trees. There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!\n\nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! Once you unlock the bee breeding lines, look around and pick and choose which bees really interest you. The way the breeding is done is mostly left to right, and top down. Some of the lines at the bottom might look simple, but they will require bees further up to complete first. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown here.\n\nBees have two sets of traits, one active that has effects on how the bee lives, and one Inactive but can be used for breeding. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the target bee. You can breed the bees with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. You can't see the passive traits using a Field Kit, you'll need a Beealyzer. For lots of bees, you can scan them first using a GT scanner, but you'll still need a Beealyzer to see passive traits.\n\nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee.  A bee that has little or no crossbreeding potential, but has all the traits you prefer - short life, nocturnal, cavedwelling, rain tolerant, humidity, temperature, high fertility, etc.  Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.\n\nWhen you are trying for a new bee, what you are wanting is a drone - this way you can use your "breeding stock" princess for easy breeding, but the drone to get the new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poor crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown out if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Ignoble bees are good for this, since they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles - frames can let them live longer. Once you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die. Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine.\n\nOnce you get a new species, it will replace all of one of the two sets of traits of the bee.  For example when you get a Cultivated, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated! All the quests will require purebred species. \n\nGenerally all traits can be bred into any bee species, including effects or flower preference. Species generally require their preferred biome to produce their special drops.\n\nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances, or to lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for that pristine princess to become ignoble!\n\nIt looks complex, because it is! But it also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!
