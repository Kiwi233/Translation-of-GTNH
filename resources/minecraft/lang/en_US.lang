# Quest.0 - §d§3§2§1§lYour First Night
gtnh.quest0.name=§d§3§2§1§lYour First Night
gtnh.quest0.desc=Your first task will be to find food, and a shelter for the night. The nights will be cruel, as this pack has hardcore darkness. It probably would be a good idea to collect some food now...%n%n§lNote: You don't need to keep this book, you can use tilde to open quests without the book.§r ...if your keybinds don't conflict.%n%nGo to the Discord server at §6https://discord.gg/EXshrPV§r for help outside of what the questbook offers, or just to hang out. Select an appropriate role in #role-select to get tier-appropriate advice.%n%nWe also maintain a wiki at §9https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page §rbe sure to check it out. Some of the stuff is really complicated, and needs more text to explain than the QB can do. Also, pictures. Also, beginner's guides for some stuff if you don't think the questbook is enough. There's also a list of optional mods for people that want to be even fancier, or use different fonts or w/e.%n%nAdditionally, there's the spreadsheet at §dhttp://bit.ly/gtnh-datasheets§r for info that you would would want a spreadsheet for.%n%nLastly, if you got the pack from §4Curse§r, please be aware that it doesn't always work properly (Curse doesn't play well with all the customized versions of mods we have), so if you have any problems, the first response on how to fix it will be to switch to another launcher like §9MultiMC§r or §aTechnic§r. The latest version is available on the discord channel from #announcements or with the !download command.%n%n§3Hopefully you didn't get munched by a monster while reading this.

# Quest.1 - §1§lWhere's the Flint?
gtnh.quest1.name=§1§lWhere's the Flint?
gtnh.quest1.desc=As you might have noticed, while collecting gravel, no flint dropped for you. Well, there is a... recipe for that. Look up flint in NEI and craft some!

# Quest.2 - §1§lSticks 'n Stones
gtnh.quest2.name=§1§lSticks 'n Stones
gtnh.quest2.desc=This book has a built-in reading light, lucky you! You can read about quests while you're waiting for the night to be over, but for now, you may want to get the basics done. If it isn't dark already, go out and collect some gravel and wood. Keep in mind that you need food, so look for Pam's Harvestcraft gardens. (And save some of the vegetables for seeds!)%n%n§3If you haven't already, make sure to read the info quests linked from the first quest when you can, they have important info!

# Quest.3 - §1§lStorage For Days
gtnh.quest3.name=§1§lStorage For Days
gtnh.quest3.desc=Now that you've gotten your tools and are about to go collect a bunch of stuff, it's about time to make some storage for your goods. Take some of your wood, and craft a chest. You will need 4 wood, 4 planks and 1 flint.

# Quest.4 - §1§lMain Quests and Secondary Quests
gtnh.quest4.name=§1§lMain Quests and Secondary Quests
gtnh.quest4.desc=Now that you've made it this far, notice the two new quests. See how these two quests look different? The quest with the jagged edges is a main quest and is linked to other main quests by a thick line. You must complete the main quests to unlock the next tier, or to progress in general. If you can't progress, go back to previous tiers and look for uncompleted main quests. The other quest is an optional quest, and is not needed to unlock new tiers. However, optional quests often introduce you to useful items or processes.%n%nWhat are the coins? You can use them to purchase things in the Coins tab. In case you started in a bad biome, I'll give you enough coins to purchase some saplings.

# Quest.5 - §1§lTools
gtnh.quest5.name=§1§lTools
gtnh.quest5.desc=Now that you've got a shelter and a crafting table, you should make some tools. (Unless you'd like to continue punching trees with your bare hand...)%n%n§3You should probably make the shovel first so you can get gravel for the rest more easily.

# Quest.6 - §1§lYou Reap...
gtnh.quest6.name=§1§lYou Reap...
gtnh.quest6.desc=You won't always get food rewards from this book, so it might be a good idea to take care of that problem. As you've created a hoe already, go and find some water nearby and make a field.  With this modpack you can only make farmland within range of water. Let's trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.%n%nTo get other wheat, use a hoe on grass away from water. You'll get Witchery seeds too, save those for later. Start planting a cotton field, it's a key early game resource.%n%n§3PS: You can also grab a bunch from villages, and also grow the seeds from Pam's garden food.

# Quest.7 - §1§l...What You Sow
gtnh.quest7.name=§1§l...What You Sow
gtnh.quest7.desc=If you, by chance, did read the previous quest and planted the carrot I gave you, then you're fine. Meanwhile, you should turn some more fruits and vegetables into seeds, and increase the size of your farm to get a steady supply of food.

# Quest.8 - §1§lGet That Stone
gtnh.quest8.name=§1§lGet That Stone
gtnh.quest8.desc=Look at you, with your shiny flint pickaxe! Time to mine some cobblestone. Yay! (And maybe you can improve this dirt-hut too...)

# Quest.9 - §1§lFire, Fire, Grandpa!
gtnh.quest9.name=§1§lFire, Fire, Grandpa!
gtnh.quest9.desc=Time to burn some stuff, isn't it? You can't make charcoal in it, but you sure will find some usage for it soon™.

# Quest.10 - §1§lRest in Pieces
gtnh.quest10.name=§1§lRest in Pieces
gtnh.quest10.desc=It's GLOPPing time! Go kill some pigs to gather meat. (And yes, they will drop cooked porkchops. Now isn't that useful...)

# Quest.11 - §1§lSharpness: Over... 5...
gtnh.quest11.name=§1§lSharpness: Over... 5...
gtnh.quest11.desc=It's about time to craft something more useful: A sword!%n%nNow that you have a sword, you will get credit for monster kills in the Kill All the Things tab. Watch out, monsters in this world will chew you up and spit you out!%n%n§3PS: You can find additional weapon quests on the Getting Around Without Dying tab.

# Quest.12 - §1§lFluffy and Red
gtnh.quest12.name=§1§lFluffy and Red
gtnh.quest12.desc=Epic quest: Kill some sheep! (And try to get some wool, for a bed, obviously...)

# Quest.13 - §1§lSO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
gtnh.quest13.name=§1§lSO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
gtnh.quest13.desc=Sleepy time, and the end of the tutorial. Congratulations, you've built your first hideout, and you should have a steady supply of food by now. See you again in tier 0!

# Quest.14 - §1§lWhat's That...?
gtnh.quest14.name=§1§lWhat's That...?
gtnh.quest14.desc=You've seen a lot of trees, but there are a few that look really special. You are sure that these trees are much more than just wood to build your home with or used to get charcoal. You're sure that these will be Very Important soon™.%n%nThe best place to find them is in a Magical Forest, but if you can't find one you can try a Garden or Cherry Wood Grove. Or just randomly everywhere.%n%n§3If you have trouble finding them, you can go to "Coins, Coins, Coins" tab and buy them.

# Quest.15 - §2§lReady, Set, Go!
gtnh.quest15.name=§2§lReady, Set, Go!
gtnh.quest15.desc=You probably should have a home by now. A steady supply of food is a fundamental requirement at all times. Take this journal to keep track of the things you've eaten. You will have to travel far in this tier, better be prepared!

# Quest.16 - §4§3§lBetter Tank... Iron Tank
gtnh.quest16.name=§4§3§lBetter Tank... Iron Tank
gtnh.quest16.desc=Storing more than 16 buckets of fluid in one tank? Sure! Just make an iron tank or upgrade the Buildcraft tank.%n%nDiamond tanks carry up to 64 buckets and obsidian ones are blast proof. There's even more past that, but you should probably use GT tanks or large cells instead.

# Quest.17 - §2§lSand: The Gathering
gtnh.quest17.name=§2§lSand: The Gathering
gtnh.quest17.desc=In a strange vision you saw a big structure which would allow you to make charcoal. Finally some torches! According to your calculations, you will need a lot of sand for that.

# Quest.18 - §2§lBasic Processing
gtnh.quest18.name=§2§lBasic Processing
gtnh.quest18.desc=Most things are unavailable at the moment, so let's begin with something simple. Take some of your cobblestone and smelt it into regular stone. Since this modpack is evil, you'll need to use wood for that. How much fun is that?!

# Quest.19 - §1§2§lMacerator v0.1 Alpha
gtnh.quest19.name=§1§2§lMacerator v0.1 Alpha
gtnh.quest19.desc=This fancy little device works (almost...) like a macerator. Some people say it's even better, since it does not require power, yay! You only need to craft one for this quest, but you probably should make some more if you can...

# Quest.20 - §2§lGravel: The Gathering
gtnh.quest20.name=§2§lGravel: The Gathering
gtnh.quest20.desc=Your tools will eventually lose durability. You think it would be a good idea to collect more gravel in order to provide yourself with flint for more tools. Try searching near water.

# Quest.21 - §2§lClay: The Gathering
gtnh.quest21.name=§2§lClay: The Gathering
gtnh.quest21.desc=While bored, you thought that it might be a good idea to take up pottery. You should go and find some clay, the riverbanks should have some.

# Quest.22 - §2§lFinite Water!?
gtnh.quest22.name=§2§lFinite Water!?
gtnh.quest22.desc=Finite water is a problem, that's for sure. Last night, you had an idea. If you can drink cacti, you should also be able make water out of 8 cacti and use that for most recipes that require water. How cool is that? So what about another trade? 10 wood for... 3 cacti so you can setup a farm. Deal?%n%nTo automate the farm, place a string next to the cactus and a sand on top of the string. Now when the cactus grows, it will automatically break!  You can stack this horizontally and vertically to make a very efficient cactus farm.  Use water to redirect the cactus to a convenient pickup location or to above a hopper.%n%nFirst player to make a base running off of only cactus water gets a cape!

# Quest.23 - §2§lSomething to Carry Liquids
gtnh.quest23.name=§2§lSomething to Carry Liquids
gtnh.quest23.desc=You tried to move water with your bare hands, which didn't work at all. Luckily, you remember how to make a bucket out of clay dust.%n%nPut it in a mortar to get small clay dust which can be crafted to clay dust.

# Quest.24 - §1§2§lGetting (Char)coal
gtnh.quest24.name=§1§2§lGetting (Char)coal
gtnh.quest24.desc=It's time to get yourself some charcoal. For that, we're going to build a coke oven. Good that you just collected a lot of resources! (What a coincidence...)%n%n§3Even though Waila says you can't, you can punch these blocks to get them back if you mess up the placement before you have a metal pickaxe.

# Quest.25 - §2§lAnother Brick in the Wall
gtnh.quest25.name=§2§lAnother Brick in the Wall
gtnh.quest25.desc=Your vision becomes more clear, you'll need bricks for your first multiblock structure. You think that 104 bricks should be enough. However, the bricks you'll need are somewhat special. Make sure to craft the correct ones!%n%n§3Make sure to collect them all before you move on to putting them in the furnace if you actually want to complete the quest!

# Quest.26 - §2§lForming Press v0.1
gtnh.quest26.name=§2§lForming Press v0.1
gtnh.quest26.desc=As you may have noticed, you cannot turn clay into bricks directly. Well, to be fair, it wasn't a good recipe anyway. You'll probably end up with something bread-shaped. So in order to make bricks, you need a form. Get yourself a knife (flint above a stick) and a blank pattern, and cut a brick sized piece out. It's as easy as that.

# Quest.27 - §2§lFinally, Some Powerful Fuel
gtnh.quest27.name=§2§lFinally, Some Powerful Fuel
gtnh.quest27.desc=Now that you have a coke oven, you can start producing charcoal. The more, the better. Don't worry about the creosote; I have another deal for you...

# Quest.28 - §2§lCopper Sky, Iron Curtain
gtnh.quest28.name=§2§lCopper Sky, Iron Curtain
gtnh.quest28.desc=With your newly acquired fuel source, you are now ready to process more advanced materials than stone or clay; Iron or Copper, for example. Just in case you don't know, they spawn in rather large veins. Use the following quests to locate the most important veins.

# Quest.29 - §2§lAnother Fuel Source
gtnh.quest29.name=§2§lAnother Fuel Source
gtnh.quest29.desc=Lignite and regular coal are the fuel sources you'll definitely need. The latter can be turned into coal coke, which is a superior fuel source to smelt your first large batch of ore.%n%nLignite you can toss in a boiler once you have one.

# Quest.30 - §2§lCopper
gtnh.quest30.name=§2§lCopper
gtnh.quest30.desc=Copper ingots can be created by smelting copper, chalcopyrite, or malachite ore.

# Quest.31 - §2§lTin
gtnh.quest31.name=§2§lTin
gtnh.quest31.desc=Tin ingots can be created by smelting Tin, Cassiterite, or Cassiterite Sand ore. Tin and Cassiterite ores are only found at high altitudes, but Cassiterite Sand ore is plentiful near the surface.%n%n§5§4Tip: If you get lucky and find a high altitude Tin/Cassiterite vein, save one of the Cassiterite ore to find a Mica vein later on using the ore finder wand.

# Quest.32 - §2§lBook Parts
gtnh.quest32.name=§2§lBook Parts
gtnh.quest32.desc=After you found a way to move water around, you had another brilliant idea: Paper! Paper is no longer made with sugarcane, you'll need wood pulp instead. You'll need a lot of wood to craft wood pulp, so better grab your axe and go chop some trees.

# Quest.33 - §2§lTinker-Time
gtnh.quest33.name=§2§lTinker-Time
gtnh.quest33.desc=While using your flint tools is fun in terms of killing pigs and cows, they are not very good, and can't be repaired. Plus Infernals laugh at your attempts to kill them. You discovered how to craft tools that can be repaired and upgraded, but for that you definitely need a more advanced crafting technique.%n%nIf you have to use wood other than oak to make your tables, you can convert them to the default oak wood type to complete this quest.

# Quest.34 - §2§lAluminini...um...?
gtnh.quest34.name=§2§lAluminini...um...?
gtnh.quest34.desc=However it is spelled, you will need it. You can find it in chunks of gravel on the surface.%n%nUse as little as possible and save the rest for when you get a macerator in Steam age, you'll get twice as much.%n%nIf you can't find any, you can get some oreberries to plant from some quest or another. Or the coins tab.%n%nIf you get enough (and fully process it), you can also get rutile for titanium out of it. Get a block of that, and you can grow the Titania crop so you can make more out of UUM. The no-rocket run starts here!

# Quest.35 - §2§lMaking Bronze
gtnh.quest35.name=§2§lMaking Bronze
gtnh.quest35.desc=Now that you've found copper and tin, you should make yourself some bronze. Use your macer... mortar to grind up some copper and tin ingots, and mix them together!

# Quest.36 - §2§lImportant Tools
gtnh.quest36.name=§2§lImportant Tools
gtnh.quest36.desc=In order to craft even basic machines, you'll need new tools. Most of them can be replaced by machines later. For now, you should become familiar with each of their recipes, as you will need a lot of these tools, starting today.%n%nYour new tools can also be used to make Railcraft water tanks, a very useful multiblock considering the finite water feature.%n%nThere are also electric versions of the tools, you can upgrade later if you want. Also, there are many versions of the tools, they generally follow the same rules as tinkers parts in terms of how good they are, similarly to turbines. You can look at the spreadsheet for more info on GT tool stats.%n%n§3You can use whatever materials you want. The gem version of the saw is crafted differently to metal versions. Higher tier tools need steel or tungstensteel rods instead of sticks.

# Quest.37 - §2§lGetting Iron
gtnh.quest37.name=§2§lGetting Iron
gtnh.quest37.desc=Iron can be found in multiple veins. %nMagnetite veins (Y 30-180), Chalcopyrite veins (Y 5-60), and Limonite veins (Y 10-40) all contain iron ore.

# Quest.38 - §2§lMaking Better Tools
gtnh.quest38.name=§2§lMaking Better Tools
gtnh.quest38.desc=With aluminium and copper, you can create a material with a higher melting temperature, "Aluminum Brass", which can be used to cast better tools.%n%nBut first you'll need a smeltery. See the Multiblock Goals tab for details. You can also grab some extra blocks from some villages, but they don't count towards the quest.%n%nYou can then use your fancy new bronze to make better tools. Note that it has a higher mining level than iron, so you'll need it for mining some ores.

# Quest.39 - §2§lBetter Storage
gtnh.quest39.name=§2§lBetter Storage
gtnh.quest39.desc=While standard chests are good for your basic items and goods, they are not ideal for storing a large amount of ore. You should build yourself some barrels in order to keep things organized.

# Quest.40 - §2§lYou Shall Proceed
gtnh.quest40.name=§2§lYou Shall Proceed
gtnh.quest40.desc=As you've gathered and crafted all materials and tools you need for your basic steam machinery, you may now proceed to the next tier. Keep in mind that you'll need mountains of resources in order to craft even the simplest things, so you probably should stock up on all ores in this tier. But that's up to you.%n%n§5§5As a special reward you get a pair of Holo Glasses to look inside your inventories. Place it into the mask slot, and use the keybind to turn it on. Sometimes it gets turned off somehow, so try pressing the button if that happens.

# Quest.41 - §2§lDon't Burn Your Fingers!
gtnh.quest41.name=§2§lDon't Burn Your Fingers!
gtnh.quest41.desc=You have decided it's time to make some tasty pizza, but your fingers got burned badly. Reading an ancient cookbook you discovered a pair of magical items that would allow you to carry anything hot, even lava in a bucket.%n%n§6§5The gloves have to be placed in the Baubles ring slots of Thaumcraft. You also have to place each in the correct slot, you'll get a notification if it's wrong.%n%n§rFor the protection effect, the hot item has to be in your active slot. I wonder if there is some way to carry more than a few buckets at a time?

# Quest.42 - §2§r§2§lCow Tipper
gtnh.quest42.name=§2§r§2§lCow Tipper
gtnh.quest42.desc=Before you had to kill some pigs and sheep to complete quests. Now it's time to kill some cows and hopefully get some leather. If you are lucky and get a cow trophy you may never need to kill another cow in the future.

# Quest.43 - §2§lCotton, Cotton and More Cotton
gtnh.quest43.name=§2§lCotton, Cotton and More Cotton
gtnh.quest43.desc=You've found out that cotton is very useful, it can be used to make string, wool, and some other useful items too. Make a small cotton plantation to get tons of it.

# Quest.44 - §3§lWelcome to Tier 0.5, Steam!
gtnh.quest44.name=§3§lWelcome to Tier 0.5, Steam!
gtnh.quest44.desc=Welcome, and well done so far! This tier is all about your first machines, getting more stuff from your ores and making bronze ingots in a more efficient manner.%n%nFor water, check out the Water Siding Tank multiblock in the Multiblock goals tab.%n%nTo connect up your boilers, be sure to provide water from the bottom, they'll accept only water from this side, so no risk of melting your pipe. Wooden pipes are fine for this. Make sure you never run out of water - adding water to a hot boiler will cause it to explode!%n%nSteam will come out from the sides. Remember, steam is hot! It will destroy wooden pipes. And it can burn you if you walk on bronze pipes full of steam.  Cover them with wooden planks or paper. Or just don't walk on/next to them.%n%nAnd no, you can't automate it. Make an electric one if you want to do that.

# Quest.45 - §6§lMultiblock Tanks... Railcraft Tanks
gtnh.quest45.name=§6§lMultiblock Tanks... Railcraft Tanks
gtnh.quest45.desc=576 buckets of fluid, that should be enough to store all the creosote you have accumulated thus far. If that isn't enough you can make this tank bigger. The smallest tanks are 3x4x3 while the biggest are 9x8x9.%n%nHint: Fluid will auto-output (without any pumps) if you place a valve on the bottom side of the tank. The output rate is 1000 L/t so twice as fast as a GT HV Pump Cover. You can color the tank with Buildcraft paintbrushes and the GT spray can.%n%nIf you still use Railcraft tanks in later tiers, you boost the output rate by using pumps.

# Quest.46 - §3§lMore Advanced Alloys
gtnh.quest46.name=§3§lMore Advanced Alloys
gtnh.quest46.desc=Your smeltery does a great job mixing metals into alloys, but it's not very efficient, and limited in its complexity. You need something new, so why not put your steam to some use? The Alloy Smelter can make bronze for you directly, using ingots, dusts, or even nuggets. You can make a nugget mold as well to turn ingots into nuggets if you have steel.%n%nIt might also come in handy when processing raw rubber. You should keep an eye on recipes to see when machines offer better options to make items...%n%n§4NOTE: Like all steam machines, the output port doubles as a steam outlet when recipes complete. It must not be blocked. Also, steam is hot, remember? Change the output side by whacking with a wrench. The 3x3 grid will show you which side the output will move to when you whack it.%n%nIf you try enabling item output, you'll see it comes out the same side as the steam outlet. How unfortunate! However you can still empty the machine by putting a hopper beneath it. %n%nWARNING: The Alloy Smelter recipes take a §llot§r of steam. Do them one by one until you understand how fast you use steam, and how much you will need buffered. Large pipes are a decent "poor mans" buffer, and the boiler can hold quite a bit of steam, as well as the machine itself. Once you get a little further along, make a larger steam buffer with an iron or steel railcraft tank.

# Quest.47 - §3§lUpgrade: High Speed Alloys
gtnh.quest47.name=§3§lUpgrade: High Speed Alloys
gtnh.quest47.desc=Like most machines, there is a more advanced version of the alloy smelter. Keep in mind that this machine uses a lot of steam, so you better get some more boilers first.

# Quest.48 - §3§lA Very Important Alloy
gtnh.quest48.name=§3§lA Very Important Alloy
gtnh.quest48.desc=The most important alloy (until you reach a higher tier) is undoubtedly red alloy. Fortunately, you have an alloy smelter, so grab some redstone and combine it with copper to get yourself a handful of that. %n%nDon't confuse your bronze with your copper or else you'll be scratching your head.

# Quest.49 - §3§lThe Hell is That?
gtnh.quest49.name=§3§lThe Hell is That?
gtnh.quest49.desc=In order to get more machines, you'll need pistons. But not those amateurish ones, you need special ones, and I shall guide you in the making of them.%n%n§3PS: Infernals can drop them, though you won't get credit for the quest that way.

# Quest.50 - §3§lMacerator v1.0!
gtnh.quest50.name=§3§lMacerator v1.0!
gtnh.quest50.desc=Finally you are able to make a device that will replace your mortar. However, the "no-durability" feature of this device comes with a cost: You need 2 diamonds for the grinding heads.%n%nThe macerator will double your ore output. Put ores through it instead of smelting directly.%n%nNOTE: Remember, don't block the output port and don't stand behind it.

# Quest.51 - §3§lExtracting Stuff
gtnh.quest51.name=§3§lExtracting Stuff
gtnh.quest51.desc=As you'll need rubber later to make cables from wires, you should get yourself a steam extractor. You can also use this machine to get more dyes from flowers, or process different fruits into juice.

# Quest.52 - §3§4§3§lA Clear View
gtnh.quest52.name=§3§4§3§lA Clear View
gtnh.quest52.desc=Are you still living in your dirt/cobble hut? How about letting in some sunlight? Grind up some sand and flint and craft some glass dust. Put it in your smeltery and pour it into a casting basin to make clear glass.%n%n§4Hint: In order to use it for recipes, you have to chisel it.%n%n§3PS: The macerator no longer gives tiny piles, just uncraft a normal pile to get tiny ones. You'll appreciate this once you have a mixer in LV.

# Quest.53 - §3§lHammer time v2
gtnh.quest53.name=§3§lHammer time v2
gtnh.quest53.desc=Using 6 ingots to craft a hammer seems pretty wasteful, as this tool has durability. How nice would it be to have a machine that does the same but without having durability and using three ingots to make two plates? Guess what, there is one! And you should totally get one.

# Quest.54 - §4§3§lCompressing Stuff
gtnh.quest54.name=§4§3§lCompressing Stuff
gtnh.quest54.desc=This rather simple device does a very important job: compression. It's main function is to press 9 ingots into a block, but it's also useful for a variety of recipes, for example making firm tofu.

# Quest.55 - §4§3§lUpgrade: A Better Compressor
gtnh.quest55.name=§4§3§lUpgrade: A Better Compressor
gtnh.quest55.desc=An updated version of the steam compressor. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast.

# Quest.56 - §3§lUpgrade: Forge Hammer
gtnh.quest56.name=§3§lUpgrade: Forge Hammer
gtnh.quest56.desc=An updated version of the steam forge hammer. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast.

# Quest.57 - §3§lUpgrade: Extractor
gtnh.quest57.name=§3§lUpgrade: Extractor
gtnh.quest57.desc=An updated version of the steam extractor. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. You probably want to craft this, as the extractor does also extract your nerves...

# Quest.58 - §3§lUpgrade: Better Macerator
gtnh.quest58.name=§3§lUpgrade: Better Macerator
gtnh.quest58.desc=An updated version of the steam macerator. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast.

# Quest.59 - §3§lSteam Alternatives
gtnh.quest59.name=§3§lSteam Alternatives
gtnh.quest59.desc=There is more than one way to get steam for your machines. This completely optional questline shows you some alternative methods for producing steam.%n%n§3For the ones that need glass, you'll need to progress a few more quests to see how to do so, though you can also make it now if you want.

# Quest.60 - §3§lUpgrade: Coal Boiler
gtnh.quest60.name=§3§lUpgrade: Coal Boiler
gtnh.quest60.desc=This is basically just an upgrade to your current coal boiler, however it produces more than twice as much steam. Something you should consider building if you're planning to get some of the upgraded machines.

# Quest.61 - §3§lAnother Use for Java, I Mean Lava
gtnh.quest61.name=§3§lAnother Use for Java, I Mean Lava
gtnh.quest61.desc=With a more durable steel casing, you can use lava to make steam.

# Quest.62 - §3§lThe Power of the Sun
gtnh.quest62.name=§3§lThe Power of the Sun
gtnh.quest62.desc=The sun has quite a bit of power, so why not use it to produce steam? %n%nFill it with water on the bottom side to produce steam. Unlike the other boilers, this only outputs steam on the output port side.%n%n§4Hint: The solar boiler calcifies and becomes less efficient over time. Later on you can consider using distilled water to avoid calcification.

# Quest.63 - §3§lUsing Steam to Cook Things
gtnh.quest63.name=§3§lUsing Steam to Cook Things
gtnh.quest63.desc=A rather slow process, but it's more efficient than using a regular furnace.

# Quest.64 - §3§lUpgrade: Better Furnace
gtnh.quest64.name=§3§lUpgrade: Better Furnace
gtnh.quest64.desc=An updated version of the steam furnace. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast.

# Quest.65 - §3§lBlastoff!
gtnh.quest65.name=§3§lBlastoff!
gtnh.quest65.desc=It's about time to make some steel. Look in the Multiblock Goals quest tab and build a Bricked Blast Furnace. Return here once you've made at least 8 steel ingots.

# Quest.66 - §3§lTime For Some Logic
gtnh.quest66.name=§3§lTime For Some Logic
gtnh.quest66.desc=Good news! You are now able to advance to the next tier! Bad news: You still have to craft a lot of things before you can begin. Fear not mortal, I shall guide you!

# Quest.67 - §4§3§lWired, Weird?!
gtnh.quest67.name=§4§3§lWired, Weird?!
gtnh.quest67.desc=Two of the very basic materials for machines are wires and cables. For cables you can either use a rubber sheet in the crafting table or use rubber bars in the alloy smelter. Not very efficient, but there will be a better way later.

# Quest.68 - §3§lYour First Electronic Circuit
gtnh.quest68.name=§3§lYour First Electronic Circuit
gtnh.quest68.desc=Steam machines are quite stupid, they just do one thing over and over again. As you advance into the electrical age, you've decided that you want the machines to have more features, like automatic output in order to create some automation. For that, you need electronic circuits.

# Quest.69 - §3§lWire-Wrap
gtnh.quest69.name=§3§lWire-Wrap
gtnh.quest69.desc=Placing wires without insulation seems to be a bad idea. Now that you have an extractor to extract raw rubber out of sticky resin and an alloy smelter to further process it using sulfur, you should work on getting some insulating rubber bars.

# Quest.70 - §3§lSteam-a-licious!
gtnh.quest70.name=§3§lSteam-a-licious!
gtnh.quest70.desc=You've almost made it. One last crafting step is required in order to advance to Tier 1. Keep going!%n%nThis Steam Turbine generates electricity from Steam. The power source you've been using is the same, but from this point on you will generate EU, and bring it to your machines via cables, instead of bringing the Steam directly to them. Luckily, electric machines don't need an exhaust port, and they are considerably more efficient than Bronze machines.%n%nAt a later point, you will most likely switch from Steam to another fuel, though.

# Quest.71 - §3§lBasic Crafting: Motors
gtnh.quest71.name=§3§lBasic Crafting: Motors
gtnh.quest71.desc=Motors are little devices that can turn electrical power into rotational energy. Very useful for all kind of machines, and not that difficult to craft. The pattern is always the same, only the materials change with tiers. For now you can use redstone to magnetize your iron rod. Later on you will build an Electromagnetic Polarizer.

# Quest.72 - §3§lBasic Crafting: Rotors
gtnh.quest72.name=§3§lBasic Crafting: Rotors
gtnh.quest72.desc=Rotors are also crafted using an identical pattern with different materials. A bit annoying to craft at the moment, but you don't need a lot of them anyway.

# Quest.73 - §3§lBasic Crafting: Machine Hulls
gtnh.quest73.name=§3§lBasic Crafting: Machine Hulls
gtnh.quest73.desc=All machines need a hull to keep their private parts together. Good news is: They are crafted in the same way for every tier, only the materials change.%n%n§3As noted on the tooltip, you can also use a machine hull to pass EU through, at 1A. This can be useful for a 1A diode on Thermos servers, splitting cables from 4A->1A or in a cleanroom later. You can also pass items or fluids through it.

# Quest.74 - §6§6§a§9§8§7§6§5§4§3§2§1§0§3§f§k§f§l§6§lYou Are Now Prepared, Hopefully!
gtnh.quest74.name=§6§6§a§9§8§7§6§5§4§3§2§1§0§3§f§k§f§l§6§lYou Are Now Prepared, Hopefully!
gtnh.quest74.desc=No matter where you got this smeltry from, you have one now. Time for some casting!%n%nThe aluminium oreberries can be planted on cropsticks, and macerated to get small quantites of aluminium for molds if you can't find aluminium gravel.%n%nNote: The book says a 3x3 base, but you can make a smeltery with a smaller base. Taller/wider smelteries can do more items at one time, conserving fuel.%n%n§3The smeltry does not double ores in GTNH. Later machines will help you there.

# Quest.75 - §6§lThe Water Dilemma
gtnh.quest75.name=§6§lThe Water Dilemma
gtnh.quest75.desc=Finite water is a problem. But fear not, there are solutions! I shall guide you to a steady supply of water. The Railcraft water siding tanks provides enough water to last the early game.%n%nThe humidity of a biome is very important and will increase the base fill rate. If it is raining, the tank will fill much quicker. One block of the water siding tank must see sky for the maximum output. The best part is that you don't need a pump to extract water. Tanks and pipes placed next to it will be autofilled by the water siding tank.%n%n§3The block that cant be covered for maximum output is a specific one. Either try it out to find out which or just give the entire multiblcok sky access.

# Quest.76 - §6§lTime to Get Some Steel
gtnh.quest76.name=§6§lTime to Get Some Steel
gtnh.quest76.desc=You need steel? Uhh... fine. Let's get busy...%n%nHint: The bricked blast furnace can share walls with other ones, just like most GT multi blocks. How will this affect the air quality though...%n%n§3If you are short on Stone Dust, you can get more by macerating cobblestone.%n%nIf you spawn near a biome with Hardened Clay you can macerate it to get the clay dust you need. You can also use brick blocks from Villages to get brick dust in the macerator.%n%nCrafting the WorkTable from Forestry can make it easier as you can use all the buckets for crafting in one click%n%n§4You'll need 432 unfired clay brick, 432 brick, 108 clay and brick dust, 216 compressed fireclay, and 216 firebrick. Collect all the required materials for these first, or you'll have to do it again. Also, don't make the firebrick blocks until you collect all the gypsum you need unless you want to be forced to get more.

# Quest.77 - §r§6§l§5§l§o§l§r§6§lEBF-Time
gtnh.quest77.name=§r§6§l§5§l§o§l§r§6§lEBF-Time
gtnh.quest77.desc=In order to get alumin(i)um ingots, you need an electric blast furnace. It's another very important step towards victory, so let's get started.%n%nGetting the Mica for the heating coils might be a little tricky...but you can use a substitute for the first tier of coils.%n%n§4(You need 2 LV hatches with 4A of 32V total, or 3 LV hatches with MOOOORE power if the multiblock is not fully repaired)%n%n§rA few recipes produce CO2/SO2 as fluid. You can put an output fluid hatch to the top layer of the EBF to collect it otherwise it gets auto voided. It depends on the muffler hatch how much fluid you can recover. Bart's Platinum Series recipes output fluids on the BOTTOM, so if you want to do Platinum Stuff later, remember that.%n%nMoron always says - Make Muffler Moint Mup. Or point up, anyways.%n%nIf you want a really fancy EBF, you can add more input fluid hatches and store different fluids in each one.%n%nThe EBF also has a heat adjustment of 100K for each power tier above or below MV. You can only make LV energy hatches right now, but installing two LV energy hatches will overclock the EBF to MV power, eliminating the 100K penalty and setting the initial heat to 1801K.%n%nAs you upgrade your EBF over the course of the game, this heat adjustment will increase. Two MV energy hatches (overclocking to HV) will add +100K, two HV energy hatches (overclocking to EV) will give +200K, and so on. Coils only set the base value.%n%nThis adjustment does not apply to the Volcanus.%n%n§4If the pollution gets really bad, check in GT++ Multiblocks for a pollution scrubber, or upgrade your Muffler.%n

# Quest.78 - §6§lMore Heat - Kanthal Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest78.name=§6§lMore Heat - Kanthal Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest78.desc=Better materials need higher temperatures. You can just exchange the old coils with the new ones. Kanthal coils let you reach 2700K. You can even reuse the old coils in your Pyro or to make other machines, how fancy is that! If you don't have any other place to use them, you can macerate, arc furnace, or disassemble them too.%n%nIf you dont have a Vacuum Freezer yet coole the hot ingots in a MV Chemical Bath with Coolant.%n%nRemember that you can get an upgraded OC (4/4) instead of a regular one (4/2) if your coils are 1800K above the recipe temperature, as well as a EU discount. This applies to every 900K or 1800K above, so you should try to upgrade your coils as soon as you can.

# Quest.79 - §6§lNichrome Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest79.name=§6§lNichrome Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest79.desc=To reach 3600k so you can process higher tier materials like tungsten, you need nichrome heating coils.

# Quest.80 - §6§lCompress All the Things
gtnh.quest80.name=§6§lCompress All the Things
gtnh.quest80.desc=Martin's (DreamMasterXXL) favourite machine. Compress ALL the things! With explosives, of course. Boom today!%n%nNote: You might want to put this far from your living quarters, the pollution can get high really fast.

# Quest.81 - §6§lAt the End of...
gtnh.quest81.name=§6§lAt the End of...
gtnh.quest81.desc=...the universe everything freezes eventually. But waiting for the heat death of the universe might take too long. Therefore we present you the vacuum freezer. It should be good enough to cool your hot stuff.%n%nIngots that go through the EBF above a certain temperature will come out as hot ingots that need to be cooled.%n%nYou will need a minimum of 16 frost proof machine casings, the rest depends on your setup.

# Quest.82 - §7§6§lAn Unexpected Bonus
gtnh.quest82.name=§7§6§lAn Unexpected Bonus
gtnh.quest82.desc=Because we're nice developers, we decided to add a little bonus if you happen to compress charcoal. Use it in the bricked blast furnace, or in a boiler, it yields 10 times the burn time of a piece of charcoal. So one charcoal for free. This bonus only occurs on the first compression step. (But for fanciness, you should definitely get a quintuple one!)%n%n§3Of course, if you're not using BBFs or boilers, they're kinda useless.

# Quest.83 - §6§lHigh-Speed Charcoal
gtnh.quest83.name=§6§lHigh-Speed Charcoal
gtnh.quest83.desc=Sure, those coke ovens are nice, but they aren't even remotely fast enough to keep up with a large steam boiler. Luckily, there is an upgrade available! The creosote oil will not be produced, but the process will speed up dramatically. Who needs that nasty yellowish flammable stuff anyway...

# Quest.84 - §3§lWhere Can I Put All the Liquids?
gtnh.quest84.name=§3§lWhere Can I Put All the Liquids?
gtnh.quest84.desc=With your brand new alloy smelter you are able to combine two materials. What happens if you mix some obsidian dust and thickened glass? Obsidian glass, great. Your first tank that you can make would be a Buildcraft tank. This tank can carry up 16 buckets of a single fluid. It's possible to upgrade those tanks so they can hold up to 64 buckets.%nYou can also stack the tanks to increase capacity.

# Quest.85 - §6§lSmelt All the Things Stack-Wise...
gtnh.quest85.name=§6§lSmelt All the Things Stack-Wise...
gtnh.quest85.desc=...with this great invention! Upgrade power and coils to smelt absolutely ridiculous amounts of items.

# Quest.86 - §6§lTungstensteel Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest86.name=§6§lTungstensteel Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest86.desc=To process more advanced materials like enderium and niobium-titanium you need more than 3600K. Time to upgrade your EBF... again.

# Quest.87 - §6§lSteel Multiblock Tanks
gtnh.quest87.name=§6§lSteel Multiblock Tanks
gtnh.quest87.desc=Do you want to have tanks that can hold double the amount of the iron ones? Go ahead and make a steel tank. Everything else is the same.

# Quest.88 - §5§r§5§lWelcome to Tier 1, LV
gtnh.quest88.name=§5§r§5§lWelcome to Tier 1, LV
gtnh.quest88.desc=Why, hello there! It seems you've made it into the electrical age. Don't be so quick to throw away your steam machines, you'll probably want to keep using them for a while.%n%nTo make your life easier, you'll want to focus on getting a wiremill and bender first...once you suffer through making all the machine components.%n%nAfter that, the polarizer, assembler, lathe, and chemical reactor+fluid solidifier (for rubber) all help make things cheaper.%n%n§3PS: ULV doesn't exist.

# Quest.89 - §6§lMV Steam Turbine
gtnh.quest89.name=§6§lMV Steam Turbine
gtnh.quest89.desc=Having moved up to MV, you can continue using Steam. However, it's not a great idea to stay here, and other fuel types will be more useful to you instead. This is because Steam Turbine efficiency drops quickly with every tier (this one is only 75%), and the Steam itself needs big pipes to carry it around, compared to Benzene or Diesel.%n%nThat said, if you want to keep using this, then it's a good idea to build a Large Bronze Boiler or, later on, a Large Steel Boiler. You will need lots of solid fuel, probably Charcoal, so make sure you automate it! Definitely do not forget the water.

# Quest.90 - §5§lDamn You, Wire Cutter!
gtnh.quest90.name=§5§lDamn You, Wire Cutter!
gtnh.quest90.desc=After the Bending Machine, this should be your next step. You get 2 wires for every ingot. You can run them back through to get 4 fine wires each if you want those.

# Quest.91 - §5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #1
gtnh.quest91.name=§5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #1
gtnh.quest91.desc=The first item you'll need a lot of. If you want to pull items out of chests or barrels you'll need one. %n%nHint: Goes pretty well with item pipes or GT machines, adjust with a screwdriver.%n%n§3PS: Covers have a Shift-Right-Click interface now!

# Quest.92 - §5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #4
gtnh.quest92.name=§5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #4
gtnh.quest92.desc=The fourth item you'll need a lot of, and is also a pain to craft. The most painful item you need to make lots of. %n%n§3Works like a conveyor but can work with selected item slots, adjust with a screwdriver.

# Quest.93 - §5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #2
gtnh.quest93.name=§5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #2
gtnh.quest93.desc=The second item you'll need a lot of. When you want to get fluid out of tanks you'll need one. %n%nAttach it to fluid pipes or GT machines/blocks. Adjust the flow direction and redstone behavior with a screwdriver. Place it on the side facing the tank or machine. When looking at a pipe or machine, you can use the grid to place it on a side already touching another thing. You can use the grid with a screwdriver to adjust a cover on that side as well.%n%nWhen a GT pipe or machine has any cover, including a pump cover, wrenching the machine back into an item keeps the cover on that machine. The cover stays with the machine in the same direction when it is placed down again. This way you can arrange pump and conveyor covers on a machine outside a tight spot and place it there. To remove covers, use the crowbar.%n%nIt can also be further upgraded into a fluid regulator that allows precise control of fluid transfer speed.%n%n§3PS: Covers have a Shift-Right-Click interface now!

# Quest.94 - §5§lElectric Macerator
gtnh.quest94.name=§5§lElectric Macerator
gtnh.quest94.desc=It is highly recommended to get one of these, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to macerate something is a lot better when using EU.%n%nYou get the first extra slot at HV, then +1 for EV and IV. The 2nd slot is for more byproducts, and is super §osuper§r useful. The 3rd slot is for ore block dusts. The 4th slot is basically only used for recycling stuff.

# Quest.95 - §5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #3
gtnh.quest95.name=§5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #3
gtnh.quest95.desc=A piston, but more... "electrical". The third item you're going to craft a lot of in the future.

# Quest.96 - §5§lSaving Redstone
gtnh.quest96.name=§5§lSaving Redstone
gtnh.quest96.desc=Tired of using 4 redstone for 1 magnetic iron rod? Well, good news for you! The polarizer doesn't need redstone, just a little bit of power. You don't need to attach this machine to a permanent power source, it runs fine on battery power, since it uses so little.

# Quest.97 - §5§lAvengers, Assemble!
gtnh.quest97.name=§5§lAvengers, Assemble!
gtnh.quest97.desc=An absolute must have for fans of the movie. Oh, and to make all the things, of course. There's a number of recipes that take less materials to make in the assembler, or can only be made with it, so make it ASAP!%n%n§3You can use the battery slot and the other extra slot in the GUI to store unused configuration circuits.%n%nIf you've completed the Silverwood quest on the first tab, you can go to the Twilight Forest after making your Assembler. See the Novice Thaumaturgy tab for details.

# Quest.98 - §5§lNo More Filing
gtnh.quest98.name=§5§lNo More Filing
gtnh.quest98.desc=Why waste a full ingot to make a rod by using a tool which loses durability and takes even MORE ingots? With this little device, all your rod-needs shall be fulfilled (for now at least, the MV Extruder is the next step for rods).

# Quest.99 - Bzzz... Whoom... (Defunct do not complete)
gtnh.quest99.name=Bzzz... Whoom... (Defunct do not complete)
gtnh.quest99.desc=Making some flawless crystals requires a precision laser engraver.%nAt MV level the precision laser engraver becomes more important.

# Quest.100 - §5§lPress All the Things
gtnh.quest100.name=§5§lPress All the Things
gtnh.quest100.desc=With the basic forming press you can make different food items, glass arrows and some Project Red components. %n%nAt MV/HV stage you can make rotors, various AE components and make copies of your molds and extruder shapes.

# Quest.101 - §5§lMjolnir!!!
gtnh.quest101.name=§5§lMjolnir!!!
gtnh.quest101.desc=Not really required, but it is a lot faster than the steam one and it can be automated. If you feel like ore washing is too slow, use this hammer.

# Quest.102 - §5§lCutting Things Apart
gtnh.quest102.name=§5§lCutting Things Apart
gtnh.quest102.desc=An absolutely mandatory machine to have. It will cut rods into bolts, plates into casings, logs into planks, and all of that will be done with the highest possible efficiency. Totally worth it! %n%nYou can use water, distilled water, or lubricant to run it. Use lubricant if possible, as it's the best.

# Quest.103 - §5§lGetting Ready for Tier 2, MV
gtnh.quest103.name=§5§lGetting Ready for Tier 2, MV
gtnh.quest103.desc=In order to proceed forward, you need to get aluminium. A lot of it. But for now, 8 is enough to complete this quest.%n%nYour first option is alumina dust. Probably the best source for alumina is clay or hardened clay from canyons, however you need an MV machine for that, so you need to find an alternative until you have enough dust for your initial setup. For now, you can get it by centrifuging various impure piles from your ores or by smelting ruby, sapphire, or green sapphire in an EBF with carbon. Check the EBF quest in the Multiblock Goals.%n%nYou will also need an EBF to turn the alumina into aluminium ingots. For that you need cryolite. Go visit the Twilight Forest for that and find a Galena vein.%n%nYour second option is to use aluminium dust. However, you can not smelt that directly yet, even if you have an EBF. That will require higher heat levels. For now, you will have to either use a Tinker's Smeltery or a GT Compressor to turn the dust into raw aluminium which you can then smelt into ingots in the EBF. Check out the Tier 0 quest for some options to obtain the dust. %n%nBy the time you've completed this, you'll probably be done with most of the tab, but you'll still need Good Circuits (MV) to actually open up the next tier if you haven't done that yet.%n%n§3Also check the Armor and Jetpacks tab for new unlocks.%nNote: If you were exploring Twilight Forest before 2.1.1.4 you won't find any cryolite in existing veins. You'll need to explore new chunks.%nCheck out the the Lead, Galena, Silver and Cryolite quest in the Novice Thaumaturgy Tab.

# Quest.104 - §5§lYour Magic Progression
gtnh.quest104.name=§5§lYour Magic Progression
gtnh.quest104.desc=Now that you're able to produce aluminium, you may dig into magic. If you haven't unlocked basic thaumaturgy, try to find a silverwood and a greatwood sapling.

# Quest.105 - §5§lSaving Metal With Bending
gtnh.quest105.name=§5§lSaving Metal With Bending
gtnh.quest105.desc=Instead of a 3:2 ratio of ingots to plates, this machine allows for 1:1. This saves an enormous amount of metal, so make it ASAP.%n%nBTW if you want foils, just run the plate back through. There's other circuit modes, but you can discover them later.

# Quest.106 - Your First Automation
gtnh.quest106.name=Your First Automation
gtnh.quest106.desc=Well, probably not the first, but definitely something big! You'll need a cart assembler first.

# Quest.107 - Cart Modules: Coal Power
gtnh.quest107.name=Cart Modules: Coal Power
gtnh.quest107.desc=Your cart needs power, obviously. A cart can be powered via coal, solar, or lava. But for now you have to use a simple coal engine.

# Quest.108 - Automated (un-)Loading
gtnh.quest108.name=Automated (un-)Loading
gtnh.quest108.desc=You can fill and empty your cart manually, but it's a lot more convenient to automate item transfer, isn't it?

# Quest.109 - Cart Modules: Farming
gtnh.quest109.name=Cart Modules: Farming
gtnh.quest109.desc=Unfortunately, the basic farmer can't farm anything besides wheat, carrots and potatoes. It's not expensive at all, and probably the cheapest solution to give your automated food production a nice boost.

# Quest.110 - Cart Modules: Storage
gtnh.quest110.name=Cart Modules: Storage
gtnh.quest110.desc=A basic cart can't hold any items, so you need to attach special chests to it.

# Quest.111 - A Simple Cart
gtnh.quest111.name=A Simple Cart
gtnh.quest111.desc=In order to create or customize your cart you need a hull to attach your desired upgrades to. The wooden one can be used for really simple applications, but to farm wheat or wood, you need at least an iron one.%n%n§c§lWARNING: §r§cUnprotected carts can be knocked off their rails by lightning. Cover the area with glass (or any solid block) to prevent carts from disappearing.%n%nAlso, make sure to keep your cart in one chunk, or use chunkloaders covering the whole area the cart works within. Loading/unloading chunks may cause carts to disappear or duplicate.

# Quest.112 - Cart Modules: Wood Cutter
gtnh.quest112.name=Cart Modules: Wood Cutter
gtnh.quest112.desc=The basic wood cutter will break after a while, but you never have to replace it. It can easily be repaired with diamonds.

# Quest.113 - §5§lBasic Transport Pipe
gtnh.quest113.name=§5§lBasic Transport Pipe
gtnh.quest113.desc=These pipes are rather simple and won't do anything on their own. But in combination with transfer nodes, you'll soon find out how great they are.

# Quest.114 - §5§lBasic Transport: Items
gtnh.quest114.name=§5§lBasic Transport: Items
gtnh.quest114.desc=In order to transfer items, you need so called "nodes". There are some for pushing items into a pipe system, and later you'll have access to nodes that are able to pull items from attached inventories.

# Quest.115 - §5§lBasic Transport: Fluids
gtnh.quest115.name=§5§lBasic Transport: Fluids
gtnh.quest115.desc=Just like item nodes, liquid nodes transfer... liquids. But probably the best thing: They can all utilize the same transfer pipe!

# Quest.116 - §5§lAlloy Smelter
gtnh.quest116.name=§5§lAlloy Smelter
gtnh.quest116.desc=Upgrade your steam alloy smelter to an LV one.

# Quest.117 - §5§lGotta Catch 'em All
gtnh.quest117.name=§5§lGotta Catch 'em All
gtnh.quest117.desc=Sure, you can use wheat/potatoes/carrots to make animals follow you back to your base, but that can be tedious. A golden lasso is a proper solution for animal transportation.%n%nYou can use it for §oany§r passive mob, like for getting villagers back to base, or a horse across a river.

# Quest.118 - §5§lBasic Monster Prevention
gtnh.quest118.name=§5§lBasic Monster Prevention
gtnh.quest118.desc=Monsters spawning in or near your base can be annoying. Especially if you happen to get infernal creepers. Luckily, there's a good way to prevent them from spawning at all.

# Quest.119 - §3§lA Quite Different Storage
gtnh.quest119.name=§3§lA Quite Different Storage
gtnh.quest119.desc=Regular chests can fill up rather quickly if you happen to collect mob drops like swords and/or armor. By using a cabinet, you can store up to 270 items of the same type. Also, it doesn't need a dolly - you can break it normally and it will retain contents. %n%nPerfect for storing IC2 crop seeds, Forestry saplings, or bees!

# Quest.120 - §5§lProtect Your Base: Tier 1
gtnh.quest120.name=§5§lProtect Your Base: Tier 1
gtnh.quest120.desc=One needs proper protection for ones home. So why not get some turrets for safety? At the moment, 2 Turrets are available: "Potato" and "disposable item". I assume you can guess what they do and how they work...

# Quest.121 - §5§lPassive Defence
gtnh.quest121.name=§5§lPassive Defence
gtnh.quest121.desc=A more "passive" approach to base defence are walls and fences. But seriously, where's the fun in that?

# Quest.122 - §4§5§lTurret Base
gtnh.quest122.name=§4§5§lTurret Base
gtnh.quest122.desc=Turrets must be placed on top of a turret base. Only the player who initially placed the base can access and configure the turret. So don't worry about people taking your ammunition.

# Quest.123 - §5§lWho Needs That Dirt Anyway
gtnh.quest123.name=§5§lWho Needs That Dirt Anyway
gtnh.quest123.desc=You probably have a ton of items floating around in your base. So why not use them to kill your enemies?

# Quest.124 - §5§lDon't Play With Your Food!
gtnh.quest124.name=§5§lDon't Play With Your Food!
gtnh.quest124.desc=Use it to kill zombies instead. Does only a little damage, but hey, who cares?

# Quest.125 - §5§lUpgrading Intensifies
gtnh.quest125.name=§5§lUpgrading Intensifies
gtnh.quest125.desc=Your turrets probably need more space to hold more ammunition, so why not get an upgrade for that?

# Quest.126 - §6§lElectrolyzing All the Things
gtnh.quest126.name=§6§lElectrolyzing All the Things
gtnh.quest126.desc=Collected a lot of dusts you can't do anything with since you started with macerating, washing and centrifuging ores? It's finally time to get all the useful materials out of them.

# Quest.127 - Project red beginning
gtnh.quest127.name=Project red beginning
gtnh.quest127.desc=Welcome to Project Red!%n%nThis quest will teach you the basics of Projectred and show you how to set up a Ghetto AE system.%n%nThe Ghetto AE system will be really useful for sorting all of your first items%n%nFirst of all there are different types of pipes: %n%nItem Transport pipes are the most basic pipes, classified as Null-logic. They don't do anything besides connect other pipes together.%nItem Transport pipes only have the ability to take items that enter it and pass them along to another connected pipe. They will NOT connect to inventories at all. In a junction where there is more than 1 possible direction, item payloads will travel in a randomly selected direction.%n %nRouted pipes are the most advanced. These pipes 'communicate' with one-another to form pipe networks, in order to allow for incredibly complicated demand driven systems, with absolutely no redstone circuitry required.%n %nPressurized pipes are pipes that use a pressure based routing system where the payload travels to the closest inventory that can accept it. Finding the closest inventory is influenced by both distance and Pressure Resistance Pipes (which, to the path finder, are 1000 blocks long), but the actual path that items take is only influenced by distance.%n%nHowever, in order to control the logic of the routed pipes you will need special circuit chips.%n%n§4Note: I have no idea how PR works, or if this questline is entirely a duplicate, and have zero willpower to read all the boring text and find out, so I just unhid them since no one came forward with any info after I asked. If it should be removed or w/e, make a ticket.

# Quest.128 - §6§lIO, IO, It's Off to EnderIO We Go
gtnh.quest128.name=§6§lIO, IO, It's Off to EnderIO We Go
gtnh.quest128.desc=You've probably used EnderIO before. It's quite useful for a lot of things. But the recipes are different and it's not as useful for some things like ore processing. Let's go through what it has to offer. Note that the other half is in HV.

# Quest.129 - §6§lMachine Chassis
gtnh.quest129.name=§6§lMachine Chassis
gtnh.quest129.desc=All EnderIO machines still require the basic chassis, and it's almost the same recipe as before; Except that you need plates instead of ingots. But that shouldn't be a problem at all...

# Quest.130 - §6§lPortable Tanks
gtnh.quest130.name=§6§lPortable Tanks
gtnh.quest130.desc=Until now, you had to use buildcraft tanks with dollies to carry liquids around. Which can be a pain with all that slowness. These portable tanks from EnderIO are able to push and pull liquids by themselves, as they have a built-in pump which is powered by some magic energy source. How convenient.%n%nThe pressurized versions are twice as large.%n%n§3Just be careful, because it will eat water cells instead of returning them. 

# Quest.131 - §6§lSimple RF power: Solid
gtnh.quest131.name=§6§lSimple RF power: Solid
gtnh.quest131.desc=By simply burning coal as fuel, this machine produces RF power. Enough for a basic machine setup. This machine will also accept compressed and multiple-compressed blocks. Want to burn something for 250+ days? Also, with double or octadic capacitors the output will increase and efficiency will improve.%n%nGT wiring can convert EU to RF, but not the other way around. Note that with the eNet changes a GT wire network will need at least one GT energy consumer - a machine hull of the matching voltage will work.%n%nEnder IO machines and GT cables and Wires can be left safely out in the rain.%n%nIt might be useful for Genetics machines since they consume excessive power when attached to GT wiring - Forestry and EnderIO machines work fine (except for the Thermionic Fabricator). Or use a Capacitor Bank.

# Quest.132 - §6§lSimple RF Power: Liquids
gtnh.quest132.name=§6§lSimple RF Power: Liquids
gtnh.quest132.desc=This generator requires both water as coolant, and a burnable liquid as fuel. The amount of power it produces depends on the type of liquid used.%n%nFuel           Burn Time (ticks/mb)    Power Output (RF/tick)    Power Output (RF/mb) %nOil                5                          30                               150%nHootch          6                          60                               360%nEthanol        15                          40                               600 %nFire Water    15                          80                              1200%nDiesel/Fuel   25                          60                              1500%n%n§3Rocket Fuel is disabled.

# Quest.133 - §9§lThe Power of Endermen
gtnh.quest133.name=§9§lThe Power of Endermen
gtnh.quest133.desc=Elevators are nice, but they're limited to vertical teleportation, and their range is also highly limited. Travel anchors don't have a limitation on angle, you can teleport from one anchor to any other within 128 blocks. You do this by looking at the anchor you wish to travel to and pressing the shift button. You can also name them and even set them as private if you like. They have a 2s cooldown.

# Quest.134 - §6§lConduits
gtnh.quest134.name=§6§lConduits
gtnh.quest134.desc=Probably the most awesome way to transport just about anything in multiple different ways. Get some conduits of each type. Higher tiers of each (except item) exist.%n%n§3There's also ME conduits for when you can do that.

# Quest.135 - §6§lYet Another Wrench
gtnh.quest135.name=§6§lYet Another Wrench
gtnh.quest135.desc=The Yeta Wrench is more than just a regular wrench. While holding it, you are able to switch between conduit types, eventually allowing you to remove one specific conduit type from a bundle of many. Ctrl-Mousewheel will switch modes, also Shift-Leftclick allows you to open the configuration interface even if you don't have access to that side of the conduit.

# Quest.136 - §6§lImproving Conduits
gtnh.quest136.name=§6§lImproving Conduits
gtnh.quest136.desc=Conduits on their own are pretty awesome, but you can do better. By using filters and speed upgrades, you gain even more control over what they do and how fast they work.%n%n§3PS: You can't make all of these right now.

# Quest.137 - §6§lMaking Things Pretty
gtnh.quest137.name=§6§lMaking Things Pretty
gtnh.quest137.desc=While conduits on their own are already awesome, you can also hide them if you want. There are 2 types of facades, basic and hardened. While basic ones are simple and easy, the reinforced ones are able to withstand explosions and mining with tools. You have to use your Yeta Wrench to remove it.%n%nYou'll have to paint your facades in the Painting Machine first - place the block you want them to look like where the paintbrush is, and the facade on the left. Of course, the Painting Machine needs to be powered.

# Quest.138 - §5§6§lCome to the Dark Side...
gtnh.quest138.name=§5§6§lCome to the Dark Side...
gtnh.quest138.desc=...we have cookies.

# Quest.139 - Luke, I'm Your Father
gtnh.quest139.name=Luke, I'm Your Father
gtnh.quest139.desc=With that dark steel you got, you may now craft yourself a new set of armor. While pretty basic at first, it can be upgraded later to unlock powerful features.

# Quest.140 - §6§lDark Steel Tools
gtnh.quest140.name=§6§lDark Steel Tools
gtnh.quest140.desc=There are also tools made of dark steel. Each of them can receive upgrades. Hold shift to get the tooltip which will explain what you need in order to upgrade them.%n%nThese tools can also be enchanted like vanilla tools.%n%nThe Ender will increase wither skull and ender pearl drops. It can be upgraded to teleport the player.%n%nDark shears can be empowered, and then will shear a large area, including leaves. Handy for clearing away that giant redwood! Maybe you will find other uses for it.%n%nThe axe, once empowered, can be recharged wirelessly while in farming station.%n%nThe pick? Well, it can mine cobalt I guess if you haven't gotten a tool capable of that yet. You could keep it around to use for base decorations if your normal pick is too fast, I suppose.

# Quest.141 - §9§lVibrant Crystals
gtnh.quest141.name=§9§lVibrant Crystals
gtnh.quest141.desc=Vibrant capacitor banks need this magical crystal. Armor and tools can be upgraded with it too.

# Quest.142 - §6§lBrewing Liquids
gtnh.quest142.name=§6§lBrewing Liquids
gtnh.quest142.desc=This machine is not only capable of brewing more powerful burnable liquids, it can also be used to brew nutrient distillation, which might have further usage soon™.%n%nNote that you get different ratios depending on what item you use for recipes that allow alternates. Use what you like.

# Quest.143 - §6§lSmelting All-Joy
gtnh.quest143.name=§6§lSmelting All-Joy
gtnh.quest143.desc=This combination smelter allows you to produce fused quartz and quite clear glass of all variants.%n%nIt does §onot§r alloy you to make the EIO alloys though, you'll need a mixer and (probably) EBF for that.

# Quest.144 - §9§lAutomated Crafting
gtnh.quest144.name=§9§lAutomated Crafting
gtnh.quest144.desc=You know, yet another automated crafting solution...%n%nThe left grid sets the recipe. The center box on the left will show the output. The right item grid is where you place resources. The output products will show up on the right center box.

# Quest.145 - §6§lOre Processing, Kind Of...
gtnh.quest145.name=§6§lOre Processing, Kind Of...
gtnh.quest145.desc=The endless war between macerators and SAG mills rages on eternally, so why does it matter which one you choose?%n%nHV Macerators are still required for the final byproducts on many ore chains, but a SAG mill still shines through with upgraded grinding heads! SAG mills are perfect machine for getting the most from your ores without using bees and crops. You can get bonus outputs with tungsten grinding heads, but that doesn't mean you can dupe materials (like ingots) with it. Plus for many of them you'll get the final output directly without any need for further processing.  Handy for processing Redstone to get Chrome!%n%nIt's great for lead, copper, tin, silver, nickel, redstone, ruby, lapis, certus quartz, and malachite ores. Other ores will give you better outputs as well if you use a good enough head.%n%nEven coal, charcoal, bones, wheat, ender pearls, and charcoal non-ores will give bonus outputs.%n%nThat said, the GT ones are still way faster later on.%n

# Quest.146 - §9§lTorture Device
gtnh.quest146.name=§9§lTorture Device
gtnh.quest146.desc=When the subjects don't want to cooperate.

# Quest.147 - H8N4C2O4 (Green) Rocket Fuel
gtnh.quest147.name=H8N4C2O4 (Green) Rocket Fuel
gtnh.quest147.desc=This is the final Rocket Fuel. With this, you can go anywhere. If you have the right rocket, of course.

# Quest.148 - §6§lTasty...
gtnh.quest148.name=§6§lTasty...
gtnh.quest148.desc=Yeah, that is... Well.. You are sure it will have a usage for something... some day... eventually... maybe...

# Quest.149 - §6§lFire Water
gtnh.quest149.name=§6§lFire Water
gtnh.quest149.desc=Too bad, you can't drink it. When used in the Combustion Generator, it will produce 80 RF/t.

# Quest.150 - §6§lHootch
gtnh.quest150.name=§6§lHootch
gtnh.quest150.desc=The lowest tier of renewable, burnable fluid. Generates 60 RF/t, but can be automated for "green" infinite power.

# Quest.151 - §9§lAutomated Mob Farming
gtnh.quest151.name=§9§lAutomated Mob Farming
gtnh.quest151.desc=Of course... zombies love that... disgusting liquid (nutrient distillation). While using a small amount per hit, he will attack everything that is within his range with a weapon you give him. That also includes players, so be careful. Rumors are there might be a weapon that will never break when used in this "machine"...%n%n§3BTW you need to be at > 75% to run it.

# Quest.152 - §9§lAnd It Will Never Break
gtnh.quest152.name=§9§lAnd It Will Never Break
gtnh.quest152.desc=By using an etheric sword, your killer joe will run...forever. Proper enchantments are a requirement for it to be efficient, but that shouldn't be a problem.

# Quest.153 - §6§lSimple Item Transfer
gtnh.quest153.name=§6§lSimple Item Transfer
gtnh.quest153.desc=Translocators can only transfer items over a distance of 1 block. But they're quite cheap, and a good solution to building compact machine setups. They include a free simple item filter which can be enabled on the input or output side. And they support multiple inputs and outputs! Glowstone will make it transfer faster - try investigating other upgrades.

# Quest.154 - §6§lSimple Fluid Transfer
gtnh.quest154.name=§6§lSimple Fluid Transfer
gtnh.quest154.desc=Just like the item translocators, the fluid ones transfer... fluids. Same restrictions apply, 1 block distance. These can also be upgraded.

# Quest.155 - §6§lHarder, Stronger, Faster
gtnh.quest155.name=§6§lHarder, Stronger, Faster
gtnh.quest155.desc=No, actually not faster. But more durable than tier 1.

# Quest.156 - §6§lProtect Your Base: Tier 2
gtnh.quest156.name=§6§lProtect Your Base: Tier 2
gtnh.quest156.desc=Slightly better protection. Now with a real gun. No more wasting food.

# Quest.157 - §6§lTier 2 Turret Base
gtnh.quest157.name=§6§lTier 2 Turret Base
gtnh.quest157.desc=Nothing to see here. Proceed...

# Quest.158 - §6§lSometimes, a Bullet Will Do
gtnh.quest158.name=§6§lSometimes, a Bullet Will Do
gtnh.quest158.desc=They hit hard. You have been warned.

# Quest.159 - §6§lBurn Them. Burn Them All!
gtnh.quest159.name=§6§lBurn Them. Burn Them All!
gtnh.quest159.desc=Hmmm, crispy bacon. What would happen if you enable neutral mobs as targeting...?

# Quest.160 - §9§lTier 3 (HV)
gtnh.quest160.name=§9§lTier 3 (HV)
gtnh.quest160.desc=Your first hull, as usual...

# Quest.161 - Paying the Highest Price
gtnh.quest161.name=Paying the Highest Price
gtnh.quest161.desc=When regular magic just isn't enough, you need something... stronger. Which is paid with blood. Your blood, and maybe others'.%n%nIn tier 1 you only need to place the blood altar. Plan for the configuration to grow in size up to 23x23 for a single altar.%n%nKeep in mind that you get less blood, and use more when crafting in GTNH. Plan for pain and frustration too.%n%nThe altar has a 10,000L blood tank, plus a 1,000L I/O buffer (you can pump in and out, but the rate is pitifully low at the start). Blood will flow to the I/O buffer until it's full, so be aware of that before your first craft.

# Quest.162 - §9§lDimensional Goal: Moon
gtnh.quest162.name=§9§lDimensional Goal: Moon
gtnh.quest162.desc=HV is about getting to the moon so you can get Titanium, used to make EV and AE2 machines. It's a long and involved task though, so head on over to the Space Race tab for more info.%n%n§3You need IV circuits and the HV assembler to start the tab though.%n%n§6If you're doing the no-rocket run, hold a stack of Titanium Ingots to proceed. Same thing for Tungstensteel when you get to EV.

# Quest.163 - §9§lI See Everything
gtnh.quest163.name=§9§lI See Everything
gtnh.quest163.desc=The inventory panel is an alternative to a PR or LP storage system. Just like PR, you have to connect every chest/barrel with an item conduit. In addition to that, you also have to install a "remote awareness" upgrade into every conduit side you want the panel to see.%n%nWell, they're all obsolete once you get AE2 though.

# Quest.164 - Portable Battery...
gtnh.quest164.name=Portable Battery...
gtnh.quest164.desc=Using this binds it to you (expect to do that a lot), and consumes one heart while depositing 200LP in your 'soul network'. You can draw upon the soul network for anything that needs LP such as Alchemy or Rituals. If you want to automate it, you can put it into your altar for a 1:1 conversion of blood. %n%nThe highest tier orb you have bound will be considered the maximum limit to LP in your network, but you'll need to put it into the appropriately tiered altar to keep absorbing blood.

# Quest.165 - §9§lSoul Eater
gtnh.quest165.name=§9§lSoul Eater
gtnh.quest165.desc=Wouldn't it be great to actually make use of the intelligence or abilities a certain creature has? For example: enderman teleportation or brain capacity of a zombie for simple logic? (He doesn't use it anyway...) With this machine, you're able to bind a captured soul to an item, which can then be used in machines to improve their functionality, or create them to begin with.

# Quest.166 - §6§lA New Alloy, Soularium
gtnh.quest166.name=§6§lA New Alloy, Soularium
gtnh.quest166.desc=There are some... "Darker" uses for machines. Stuff that might be considered "magic". Anyway, for that you need a new alloy: Soularium.

# Quest.167 - §9§lExperience Storage
gtnh.quest167.name=§9§lExperience Storage
gtnh.quest167.desc=Dying is painful, isn't it? As almost all of your precious experience is lost. But fear not, there's a solution! By using an experience obelisk, you're now able to store all your collected experience in a safe location. Other than the other way of doing it that you could already do.

# Quest.168 - §6§lA Soul Vessel
gtnh.quest168.name=§6§lA Soul Vessel
gtnh.quest168.desc=The Soul Vial is used later in HV Ender IO machines. For now though you may find it convenient to deal with....troublesome mobs. The Soul Vial is reuseable. Just right-click any living entity to steal its soul. Right click again to release it in the environment.%n%nThe possibilities swirl in your head...

# Quest.169 - §9§lThe Creation of Life
gtnh.quest169.name=§9§lThe Creation of Life
gtnh.quest169.desc=By utilizing large amounts of energy, you're able to reactivate those broken spawners you may have found in the past. If you haven't, you should get one of them now.%n%nIf the broken spawner isn't of the type of mob you want to spawn, you'll need to do some extra work. Capture one in a soul vial, then use that and the broken spawner in the soul binder to change the type. This takes forever, and also levels.%n%nCombine a BS with your Powered Spawner in an anvil to set the type for it to spawn. Then you just gotta power it up!%n%nIf you set it to capture mode, you can make souls of a specific mob without any danger.%n%n§3Please try to use as few as possible on servers, mobs are laggy. Use crops if possible.

# Quest.170 - §9§lSpecific Enchantments
gtnh.quest170.name=§9§lSpecific Enchantments
gtnh.quest170.desc=Enchanting books is, just as it is for items, random. And that's annoying if you need a specific enchantment on your tool or armor. Now there's a way to actually select enchantments. For a price, obviously.

# Quest.171 - §9§lAlmost Like Steel
gtnh.quest171.name=§9§lAlmost Like Steel
gtnh.quest171.desc=Next-gen protection against nasty zombies, creepers and other "stuff".

# Quest.172 - §9§lProtect Your Base: Tier 3
gtnh.quest172.name=§9§lProtect Your Base: Tier 3
gtnh.quest172.desc=Now we're talking: Grenades! The next in big badda boom hardware.

# Quest.173 - §9§lTier 3 Base
gtnh.quest173.name=§9§lTier 3 Base
gtnh.quest173.desc=More storage, more power, and a lot more slots for possible upgrades.

# Quest.174 - §9§lThis is Relatively Useful
gtnh.quest174.name=§9§lThis is Relatively Useful
gtnh.quest174.desc=For... some things... maybe... At least it's fun to watch?

# Quest.175 - §9§lFire in the Hole
gtnh.quest175.name=§9§lFire in the Hole
gtnh.quest175.desc=Ah, there's nothing like an explosion and the certainty that your enemies have been blasted into tiny pieces.

# Quest.176 - §a§lTier 4 (EV)
gtnh.quest176.name=§a§lTier 4 (EV)
gtnh.quest176.desc=The main goal here is to get a tier 2 rocket, and reach Mars. You also might want to rethink your power setup, as more and more machines will be upgraded. This quest set will teach you about a couple of options you have regarding power production.%n%nMultiblock goals includes quests for the large gas turbine, large combustion engine, and multiblock ore drill.

# Quest.177 - §oPoke§r
gtnh.quest177.name=§oPoke§r
gtnh.quest177.desc=Time to get some blood. You will have to start with your own...%n%nYou get 100LP in the altar for each use.

# Quest.178 - It's Storage Time!
gtnh.quest178.name=It's Storage Time!
gtnh.quest178.desc=To make an AE system, you'll need all 4 patterns, collect them all! If you hit EV without getting all of them, you can also make them yourself.%n%n§3BTW, you need a ton of Titanium to do AE2, so if you can't make it, you won't get much of anywhere.

# Quest.179 - Gotta Find Them All
gtnh.quest179.name=Gotta Find Them All
gtnh.quest179.desc=There are a lot of meteors on the surface, but there are more underground. In order to find those, you'll want a compass. The compass will only tell you the chunk has an asteroid in it, with your ore finder wand you can get a better idea where in the chunk the meteor is hiding.%n%nFor more details on AE2, check out https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-AE2

# Quest.180 - 16k Item Storage Cell
gtnh.quest180.name=16k Item Storage Cell
gtnh.quest180.desc=Middle tier storage cell, which can contain 16,384 bytes of storage. 16,384 bytes of storage can hold 2,032 stacks of a single item, or 1,040 stacks, while holding 63 different items. The 16k storage cell uses 128 bytes of data to store a single type.%n%nWhen placed inside a drive or chest will consume 1.5 ae/t.

# Quest.181 - Fluix Crystals
gtnh.quest181.name=Fluix Crystals
gtnh.quest181.desc=Not "flux"! Even if the color is the same. You need to add redstone and nether quartz to a charged certus crystal.

# Quest.182 - Applied Crafting
gtnh.quest182.name=Applied Crafting
gtnh.quest182.desc=Crafting can be a pain. So why not automate it? These can hold a single pattern each. However, if you place an ME interface against it, you can use it to craft any of the patterns in it. You can use multiple with the same MA, and given how expensive they are now, that might be a good idea. These do NOT require a channel, but do require network access.

# Quest.183 - Getting Your First Processors
gtnh.quest183.name=Getting Your First Processors
gtnh.quest183.desc=There are 3 different ways to make AE2 processors. First, there's the AE2 Inscribers, which are slow, hold one of each item at a time, require inputs (and output) from specific directions, but can be sped up with cards. Second, there's the Advanced Inscribers, which are similar, but allow stacking, and do not require specific directions. Lastly, there's GT Assemblers (and later the multiblock) which can be very fast, but require a fluid input, and consume more power. Get 8 of each one for now.

# Quest.184 - Cables
gtnh.quest184.name=Cables
gtnh.quest184.desc=To have access to your applied energistics network from your entire base, you'll need cables. A lot of them. For now, the basic ones will do, but eventually, you'll end up using dense cables and p2p channels. Glass and Covered cables are functionally identical, just different in looks. Each can carry 8 channels.  Quartz fibers don't carry channels but can carry energy. This is useful for providing power from your main network to independant subnetworks.%n%nYou can also color your cables - cables with different colors will not connect, so those can be used to expand network capacity by running parallel cables. Only fluix colored cables connect to all other colors. Later it will probably be more efficient to use P2P channels to jam a bunch of channels into 1.%n%nAnchors are like covers, keeping things from connecting when you don't want them to.

# Quest.185 - Basic Terminals
gtnh.quest185.name=Basic Terminals
gtnh.quest185.desc=The ME Terminal is an interface which gives you access to an ME network's networked storage. It has the ability to sort and search, as well as filter by using a view cell.%n%nThe ME Crafting Terminal is the upgraded version of the ME terminal which has an integrated crafting grid with access to an ME network's networked storage.%n%nThe ME Interface Terminal gives remote access to all interface pattern slots on your network separated by which type of machine they are on. It will show the type of machine in the terminal, however you can name the ME interface in the inscriber or an anvil to alter the name displayed in the ME interface terminal. If you use Ender Chests to send stuff elsewhere to be processed a lot, this may help with reducing confusion. You can also search for a specific device.

# Quest.186 - §a§lDimensional Goal: Mars
gtnh.quest186.name=§a§lDimensional Goal: Mars
gtnh.quest186.desc=Mars has a few new ores you need to find like tungsten, uranium and desh. You can centrifuge uranium-238 for U-235 and plutonium-239, which can also be centrifuged to get Pu-241 if you happen to need it.

# Quest.187 - §a§k§l§r§a§lDimensional Goal: Phobos
gtnh.quest187.name=§a§k§l§r§a§lDimensional Goal: Phobos
gtnh.quest187.desc=Phobos has new ores, go get them!%n%n§3Honestly, aside from the dungeon, Phobos has all the ores you need.

# Quest.188 - §a§lDimensional goal: Deimos
gtnh.quest188.name=§a§lDimensional goal: Deimos
gtnh.quest188.desc=You can actually get the ores you want from the other two, but visit if you like?

# Quest.189 - §a§lHEV Mark III Protective System
gtnh.quest189.name=§a§lHEV Mark III Protective System
gtnh.quest189.desc=Some items will give you a Radiation debuff without protection. How long it lasts depends on the item. Some items will give you an enormous or unlimited time debuff timer, which effectively kills you because there's no way to get rid of it.%n%nOther items will give you a general sickness with many debuffs, but not Radiation. That can be removed the normal ways, Milk, Terrawart, Aqua bees, etc.%n%nIf you wear a Hazmat suit (and rubber boots!) you are not affected by radioactive effects at all. Same for some other armors that list hazmat protection.

# Quest.190 - §a§lAppropriate Power
gtnh.quest190.name=§a§lAppropriate Power
gtnh.quest190.desc=Whether you used magic, steam, oil or biogas for power until now, you will run into problems as you advance to higher tiers. So you'll need to upgrade your power grid, at least for your EBF(s). So let's start with something more powerful: A nuclear reactor!%n%nIf you want to know how they work, refer to The Internet or the Reactor Planner at https://github.com/MauveCloud/Ic2ExpReactorPlanner/releases%n%nNote: The EU multiplier is set to 10x in this pack. That means your nuclear reactor is 10 times more efficient. Make sure to set the planner to GTNH mode under advanced. Also, the base numbers (before 10xing) can be seen on the hover text for all the components.%n%nIf you just want to use them, go to https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Nuclear_Reactors for reactor designs. The Thorium 1920 EU one is probably best for now.

# Quest.191 - Standard Nuclear Fuel: Uranium
gtnh.quest191.name=Standard Nuclear Fuel: Uranium
gtnh.quest191.desc=Just "regular" uranium fuel, nothing special about it. It produces 5x the power, and 4x the heat of thorium, while lasting 2/5 the time.%n%nMost fuel rods are basically this, but slightly modified. You generally get this from Mars and it's moons, but you can get a little from centrifuging thorium if you want.%n%nBTW, one of the reactor types 'pulses' the reactor to turn it off once it gets too hot. You can pack in the rods and then cool it off for a while to get higher efficiency out of each rod. Try it if you like explosions.

# Quest.192 - Tricky Nuclear Fuel: MOX
gtnh.quest192.name=Tricky Nuclear Fuel: MOX
gtnh.quest192.desc=Under normal conditions, produces the same amount of power as uranium, but MOX produces more power the more you let the reactor heat up. Try to come up with a heat-neutral design as close to the limit as possible to take advantage of this. It lasts 1/2 the time, and produces more heat once the reactor is over 50%. A fuel for all the engineers out there.%n%n§3You'll need to run a uranium reactor for a while to get some plutonium if you don't have another way to get it. Remember that there's more than 1 type!%n%n§4Make sure to test in creative and/or use protection against explosions!

# Quest.193 - §a§lBasic Nuclear Fuel: Thorium
gtnh.quest193.name=§a§lBasic Nuclear Fuel: Thorium
gtnh.quest193.desc=The weakest of all fuel rods, but very easy to produce, very easy to keep cool and runs twice as long as uranium. It even returns 1/3 of the thorium back later. A perfect "fission and forget" power source.%n%n§4Note: After they're used up you can recycle them to get Lutetium which is used for making americium in the fusion reactor. Americium is §lneeded§r§4 for top tier materials later, so start stockpiling now. Plus, you get power!

# Quest.194 - §a§lMonitoring Your Reactor
gtnh.quest194.name=§a§lMonitoring Your Reactor
gtnh.quest194.desc=It's important to monitor your reactor (Or just fancy to have a big screen somewhere...). So now that you've gained knowledge about the available fuel rods, you can start to build yourself a power plant. Here is something to help you out.%n%nUse the sensor kit on the block you want to monitor, then put the sensor card in the display panel. Next select which lines of information you want to display.

# Quest.195 - §a§lIncreasing the Capacity
gtnh.quest195.name=§a§lIncreasing the Capacity
gtnh.quest195.desc=To unleash the full potential of your reactor, you have to attach six reactor chambers to it.

# Quest.196 - §a§lMove the Heat
gtnh.quest196.name=§a§lMove the Heat
gtnh.quest196.desc=Reactors heat up, so you need to "move the heat away" to somewhere else. Either read a wiki and try to comprehend how these work, or give up and just use the versions on the wiki.

# Quest.197 - §a§lVenting Heat
gtnh.quest197.name=§a§lVenting Heat
gtnh.quest197.desc=You can't just move the heat around, eventually you need to get rid of it. Just like the exchangers, there are different types of vents, each of them has a certain usage. Same as the other quest, either read a wiki and try to comprehend how these work, or give up and just use the versions on the wiki.

# Quest.198 - Alternate Nuclear Fuel: Tiberium
gtnh.quest198.name=Alternate Nuclear Fuel: Tiberium
gtnh.quest198.desc=They're the same as uranium but produce half as much heat. Given that there's no reactor designs floating around, and the fact that you need to go to Ross128ba, a T5 rocket (LuV) planet to get the tiberium, I'm gonna say they're probably not worth it. If you disagree, make a design and show it to people, 'kay?

# Quest.199 - §a§lQuit Exhaling Dusts
gtnh.quest199.name=§a§lQuit Exhaling Dusts
gtnh.quest199.desc=The QED is used to make only a few things, so I'll just list them here:%n%nMagnum Torch: Prevent mob spawns.%nEnder Quarry, and the Ender-Markers that go with it: Quarry up the landscape, so you can get planet blocks, dirt, etc, unlike miners.%nEnder-Thermic Pump: For nether lava pumping with less lag.%nTransfer Node Energy/Hyper-Energy: Transfers RF, so. useless.

# Quest.200 - §a§lAdvanced Mob Protection
gtnh.quest200.name=§a§lAdvanced Mob Protection
gtnh.quest200.desc=Like the chandelier, the magnum torch prevents monsters from spawning. However, its range is quite big, so a single one might be enough for your entire base. The range is 64 blocks horizontally in each direction, and 32 up and down.%n%n§4Don't forget, monsters can still follow you home!

# Quest.201 - §c§lAutomated Mining
gtnh.quest201.name=§c§lAutomated Mining
gtnh.quest201.desc=The QED enables you to assemble the most convenient device for mining: The ender quarry.%n%nAs 0lafe says, "This small black box is life-changing" and "Sympathy for the amount of dense obsidian plates you need."%n%nGuess you better get compressing!%n%n§4NOTE: It's best to place your quarry and markers on orevein boundaries. This way you start getting ores right away, especially from planets.

# Quest.202 - §c§lAccelerating Things
gtnh.quest202.name=§c§lAccelerating Things
gtnh.quest202.desc=If an ender quarry won't satisfy your needs for MOOORE. A speed upgrade is required.

# Quest.203 - Bundled AE Channels
gtnh.quest203.name=Bundled AE Channels
gtnh.quest203.desc=P2P tunnels. You'll probably want a bunch of them! They act as teleport points from one place to another for the contained information. You need to use a §odifferent§r network to transfer them, so use a subnetwork for that.%n%nThey can pack up to 32 channels into 1 channel and transport those to the destination P2P bus. Each P2P tunnel requires 1 free channel. P2P connections cannot be nested, but one transport cable can carry multiple P2P connections. For a normal fluix cable, that's 4 P2P connections, and 16 for dense. You could also use a ME controller on your subnework if that just isn't enough. Or use separate cables.%n%nGenerally, you'll want to have the first point be one side of an ME Controller block (remember you can add more!), and the other where some of your machines are.%n%nA nice online guide can be found at https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-AE2 under P2P tunnels.%n%n§IIf you want to use one of the P2P tunnels for something §oother§r than ME channels, use an applicable item on the center of the face of the tunnel, (for example, a GT cable for GT EU, redstone for RS signal, an RF conduit for RF, a torch for light, a bucket for fluid, a chest for items, or an OC cable for OC) and it will convert to that type, even if you pick it up. Use a fluix cable to change it back.

# Quest.204 - Load and Unload the Rocket
gtnh.quest204.name=Load and Unload the Rocket
gtnh.quest204.desc=What use has an automated rocket, if you can't load and unload it with automation?

# Quest.205 - Cargo Rocket: For the Fun
gtnh.quest205.name=Cargo Rocket: For the Fun
gtnh.quest205.desc=No need to fly to distant planets on your own, just to grab ores.%n%n§3Usefulness level: Doubtful.

# Quest.206 - Venting the Heat
gtnh.quest206.name=Venting the Heat
gtnh.quest206.desc=A low tech method to cool down the hot coolant is to use vent covers. Just place the cover on any GregTech block which can contain IC2 coolant and place water in front. The easiest might be just a tank or pipe. This will help until you have access to a Large Heat Exchanger or a Vacuum Freezer.%n%nAn advanced or overclocked reactor vent is much faster than a basic heat vent but you can't make those yet. Those covers also work with a air in front, but the basic heat vent needs a water block in front. Obviously, all vent covers are faster with water in front than with just air.

# Quest.207 - §a§lTurret Base Tier 4
gtnh.quest207.name=§a§lTurret Base Tier 4
gtnh.quest207.desc=Even more range, power and upgrade slots.

# Quest.208 - §a§lProtect Your Base: Tier 4
gtnh.quest208.name=§a§lProtect Your Base: Tier 4
gtnh.quest208.desc=The small parts for the powerful turrets.

# Quest.209 - §a§lMake Love, Not War
gtnh.quest209.name=§a§lMake Love, Not War
gtnh.quest209.desc=For those who don't want to kill things. Just teleport them away, however this takes a large amount of power.

# Quest.210 - §a§lWhy Grenades...
gtnh.quest210.name=§a§lWhy Grenades...
gtnh.quest210.desc=...when you can use rockets? Yes, rockets! They search and destroy, and go off with a huge boom.

# Quest.211 - §a§lTier 4 Fence and Walls
gtnh.quest211.name=§a§lTier 4 Fence and Walls
gtnh.quest211.desc=Another upgrade for your walls. One more to go!

# Quest.212 - §a§lPulverize the Planet
gtnh.quest212.name=§a§lPulverize the Planet
gtnh.quest212.desc=Literally. You can grind the rock of most planets, to get a chance for...stuff. It depends on the planet. Does consume quite a bit of power, but can really help you out.%n%nFor Tungstate, you can centrifuge previously macerated moon dust, macerate end stone with an HV+ macerator and then centrifuge it, or centrifuge endergoo (found all over the end, does not give back buckets).%n%nIf you want to make your rocket, you need to get at least a little before you can get to a planet with the ore.%n%n§3Do one of the tasks.

# Quest.213 - §1§b§l§1§2§3§4§5§4§6§7§8§9§a§b§c§d§e§c§b§lTier 5 (IV)
gtnh.quest213.name=§1§b§l§1§2§3§4§5§4§6§7§8§9§a§b§c§d§e§c§b§lTier 5 (IV)
gtnh.quest213.desc=IV-Level. You will need tungstensteel for machines. Suggested planets and moons to visit: Mars, Phobos, Deimos. %n%nMake sure to get a set of Tungstensteel coils for your EBF.%n%nYou should've learned "how to gregtech" by now, if not go clean up the machine craters in your base...%n%nGT++ multiblock processing machines unlock at this tier. Make sure you have an Alloy Blast Smelter from EV tier ready to go.

# Quest.214 - A Reward
gtnh.quest214.name=A Reward
gtnh.quest214.desc=You have really come a long way to get here! However, getting to the moon is just the start of your journey, as you'll have access to even more powerful and awesome stuff. You have proven yourself worthy, and mastered the challenges to get here. Congratulations!%n%nPick one of the reward quests below.

# Quest.215 - §b§lOn Your Way to Asteroids and Other Rocket Tier 3 DIMs
gtnh.quest215.name=§b§lOn Your Way to Asteroids and Other Rocket Tier 3 DIMs
gtnh.quest215.desc=There's some good stuff in the asteroids, so you should stop by. Especially for the naquadah.

# Quest.216 - Portable Clean Energy IV
gtnh.quest216.name=Portable Clean Energy IV
gtnh.quest216.desc=This is the IV version.

# Quest.217 - Reward choice: Personal Dimension
gtnh.quest217.name=Reward choice: Personal Dimension
gtnh.quest217.desc=Tired of mobs in your base? Want to build somewhere... different? Probably in a personal dimension? Then this is your chance. But choose wisely; You can only pick one option.%n%nWhen you first activate the portal, you can configure the world to your liking: it can be a void world, or any superflat world as long as it only consists of blocks such as grass, stone, cobblestone, bedrock, etc.%nBe careful! Once you configure the world, you can only change the cosmetic settings such as sky color by shift-right clicking the portal.%nEditing world generation settings after the world is created is only possible if a server administrator unlocks it for you via the /pspace allow-worldgen-change DIMID command.%n%n§3PS: The Last Millenium is also a void dimension you could use.%n%n§2If you're used to the buggy garden/void dimensions from UtilityWorlds, this is now a new mod that should resolve most of the previously known issues with blood magic, etc.

# Quest.218 - Reward Choice: Loot
gtnh.quest218.name=Reward Choice: Loot
gtnh.quest218.desc=Don't need a personal dimension, eh? Well, then you'll probably be happy with some extra loot. Choose wisely; You can only pick one.%n%n§3PS: The loot is lame, don't pick this one.

# Quest.219 - §b§lAlmost Unbreakable
gtnh.quest219.name=§b§lAlmost Unbreakable
gtnh.quest219.desc=Probably not required any more, but you've made so many walls already. So why not get the best ones?

# Quest.220 - §b§lProtect Your Base: Tier 5
gtnh.quest220.name=§b§lProtect Your Base: Tier 5
gtnh.quest220.desc=Tough materials, for tough weapons. Railguns, and lasers, and... stuff. I assume you want a lot of those soon.

# Quest.221 - §b§lTurret Base Tier 5
gtnh.quest221.name=§b§lTurret Base Tier 5
gtnh.quest221.desc=The last one, I promise. Used for the most powerful turrets available. You wonder if they might help you take out some more... "Dangerous" enemies?

# Quest.222 - §b§lPewPew!
gtnh.quest222.name=§b§lPewPew!
gtnh.quest222.desc=Requires no ammo, but still does a ton of damage. All you need to do is feed it power, a lot of power.

# Quest.223 - §b§lRailguns, What Else
gtnh.quest223.name=§b§lRailguns, What Else
gtnh.quest223.desc=Massive power, and a wonderful sound when they fire. I recommend to use upgrades to increase range and damage.

# Quest.224 - Witchy (Wo)man
gtnh.quest224.name=Witchy (Wo)man
gtnh.quest224.desc=If you've made the spinning wheel and done the research, you can make these as soon as you make a 50 vis wand. They're very helpful.

# Quest.225 - Searching for Answers
gtnh.quest225.name=Searching for Answers
gtnh.quest225.desc=Last night you had a dream. A dimension, so strange and different, almost... magical? Like the saplings you found. You decided to go there and look for answers.%n%nFirst, place water in a 2x2 grid, with 12 flowers surrounding it. Then toss in a portal crystal to open it up. And no, a diamond is not enough.%n%n§3You should be able to use any vanilla flower.

# Quest.226 - See the Unseen
gtnh.quest226.name=See the Unseen
gtnh.quest226.desc=Everything is made of 6 primal aspects. Those aspects can be combined to form compound aspects, but in the end, there are only 6, kinda like the infused shards you found. You noticed that those shards start to vibrate when you bring them next to something that is made of the respective aspect. Maybe you can create a device to actually "scan" items, and reveal their compounds? This could be very useful later on.

# Quest.227 - A Table to Work On
gtnh.quest227.name=A Table to Work On
gtnh.quest227.desc=Now you need something on which to craft magical items. It probably needs to be a little magical itself. Let's see what the book says.%n%n§3I should probably take this time to read all the stuff in the Thaumonomicon I don't know about while I'm at it, instead of posting on Discord and looking stupid.

# Quest.228 - Tier 2 Sigils
gtnh.quest228.name=Tier 2 Sigils
gtnh.quest228.desc=With Reinforced Slates, you can make new sigils.

# Quest.229 - Infused Stones
gtnh.quest229.name=Infused Stones
gtnh.quest229.desc=This whole place here is filled with magic. No matter where you look at, it's just everywhere. You wonder what happens to regular stone if it's exposed to large amounts of magic for such a long time. Maybe it's time to go mining?%n%nThere are 3 veins. There's amber and cinnabar in each. They aren't super useful, but make sure to keep hold of some at least.

# Quest.230 - Your First Wand
gtnh.quest230.name=Your First Wand
gtnh.quest230.desc=You're sure that this place will give you all the answers you're looking for! To continue, you need something to handle the magic energy called "vis". Guess it's time to craft your first wand.%n%nIf you haven't started on defeating the TF bosses yet, you'll need to do so to proceed. All wands require some kind of TF boss drop, with better wands needing later boss's drops. Once you've defeated them once, you can buy a spawn egg (only usable in the TF) or use the trophy+salis mundus to make more of the drop.

# Quest.231 - Tome of Knowledge
gtnh.quest231.name=Tome of Knowledge
gtnh.quest231.desc=All the things you've discovered so far, you need to write them down. But you're lazy, and you have a wand, so why not try a magical way to "write down" your research? You wonder if you could enchant a book with your wand, so that it will keep track of your progress... You should try that on a bookshelf!

# Quest.232 - Improving Your Wand
gtnh.quest232.name=Improving Your Wand
gtnh.quest232.desc=Your wand does a great job in storing and releasing vis as you please. However, those iron caps are... §oweak§r. If you don't pay enough attention to it, it might hurt the node. Maybe you should try to improve it with caps made out of a more valuable material. Like... gold, perhaps?

# Quest.233 - Getting Shards
gtnh.quest233.name=Getting Shards
gtnh.quest233.desc=Now that you've found all six types of infused stone, you need to break those up in order to get the shards. The easiest way to do that, is to throw these stones in your Forge Hammer. Later when you have a Sifter, you can sift purified ores for more shards. An autoclave can turn shard dust into a shard. Maybe there's a magical way to do the same thing?

# Quest.234 - A "Greater" Wand
gtnh.quest234.name=A "Greater" Wand
gtnh.quest234.desc=While doing all your research and mining of these infused stones, you had an idea how to use the wood of a Greatwood tree to make a new wand. Actually, it turned out to be pretty simple, but you lacked one important thing back then: vis! The vis makes sure the wood doesn't lose it's magical conductivity while forming the rod.

# Quest.235 - Better Screws
gtnh.quest235.name=Better Screws
gtnh.quest235.desc=Unfortunately, your aluminium screws don't work with the greatwood rod. Somehow, the wood seems to repel the material. Luckily, you already have a blast furnace, so you can get a better material than aluminium.

# Quest.236 - A More Powerful "Scale"
gtnh.quest236.name=A More Powerful "Scale"
gtnh.quest236.desc=The naga scales are weak, they can only hold a very limited amount of vis. You need a better, more powerful component to store vis in your wand. You've heard rumors about an evil wizard in the Twilight Forest. Maybe he has... something... that can be used?

# Quest.237 - "Stores 50 Vis" Wand
gtnh.quest237.name="Stores 50 Vis" Wand
gtnh.quest237.desc=Now combine your new wand, and be more powerful than before! You have a feeling that this new wand will come in handy very soon™.%n%nMake sure you use the NEI 'U' command on the gold caps to find the correct GT:NH recipe for the wand.

# Quest.238 - Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
gtnh.quest238.name=Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
gtnh.quest238.desc=Your arcane table does a great job with infusing primal vis into items while crafting. However, you feel that there must be more. What if you could infuse items with all kinds of magic aspects? The possibilities are endless...

# Quest.239 - Yet Another Brick in the Wall...
gtnh.quest239.name=Yet Another Brick in the Wall...
gtnh.quest239.desc=A magical one this time. You're on your way to infusion, and you need 8 of those in total.%n%n§3Yes, you need an MV PLE, deal with it.

# Quest.240 - Essentia Cooking
gtnh.quest240.name=Essentia Cooking
gtnh.quest240.desc=In order to get essentia, you need to dissolve items. Obviously, you only want to dissolve those items you don't really need, and only those with essentia you need to craft things.%n%nMake sure you keep your furnace as empty as possible. If it fills up with essentia, it can cause a large TPS drop.

# Quest.241 - Not For Soup
gtnh.quest241.name=Not For Soup
gtnh.quest241.desc=At least not for edible soup, but for essentia slurry. Get yourself a cauldron and give it a solid whack with your wand. Place some netherrack 2 blocks under the crucible and set it on fire with some flint and steel. Lastly you need to fill it with water. This one works with pipes, so you can automate that.%n%nNow you can do crucible recipes!%n%nJust don't put in too much or, well, Bad Things will happen.

# Quest.242 - Balanced Shards sdrahS decnalaB
gtnh.quest242.name=Balanced Shards sdrahS decnalaB
gtnh.quest242.desc=By combining all six primal aspects in a crucible, you are able to make balanced shards. They can be ground up into "Salis Mundus", an absolutely crucial thing to have, trust me!

# Quest.243 - Crystal Clusters
gtnh.quest243.name=Crystal Clusters
gtnh.quest243.desc=You, as a Thaumaturge, like shiny things. And what could be more shiny than a cluster made of those shards? You totally should get one of each.

# Quest.244 - The Choice: Ignis
gtnh.quest244.name=The Choice: Ignis
gtnh.quest244.desc=In exchange for 6 clusters, I will give you this node. May it serve you well. Oh, don't place it too close to another node, or it might start to drain vis...

# Quest.245 - The Choice...
gtnh.quest245.name=The Choice...
gtnh.quest245.desc=By now, you should've collected a few (or a lot) of locations for aura nodes to get vis from. You might also have noticed that you're probably low on a certain aspect, like ordo or ignis. Well, good news. In exchange for some crystal clusters, I will give you one of my old nodes. They're all pale, but they'll still help you out. You may only choose one, so think twice before you make your decision.

# Quest.246 - The Choice: Terra
gtnh.quest246.name=The Choice: Terra
gtnh.quest246.desc=In exchange for 6 clusters, I will give you this node. May it serve you well. Oh, don't place it too close to another node, or it might start to drain vis...

gtnh.quest249.name=The Choice: Aqua
gtnh.quest249.desc=In exchange for 6 clusters, I will give you this node. May it serve you well. Oh, don't place it too close to another node, or it might start to drain vis...

# Quest.250 - The Choice: Aer
gtnh.quest250.name=The Choice: Aer
gtnh.quest250.desc=In exchange for 6 clusters, I will give you this node. May it serve you well. Oh, don't place it too close to another node, or it might start to drain vis...

# Quest.251 - Not Just For Decoration
gtnh.quest251.name=Not Just For Decoration
gtnh.quest251.desc=Sure, they look pretty, but they serve a much more important purpose: Channeling vast amounts of vis and essentia. This might be useful soon™.

# Quest.252 - This is the End...
gtnh.quest252.name=This is the End...
gtnh.quest252.desc=...of your apprenticeship. You have mastered all 6 primal aspects, you mastered the weak and strong infusion of essentia and vis, and you've already made your adept wand. But be warned, young one. The further you progress, the more darkness, and evil will tempt you to follow the forbidden ways of magic. I have seen things... weather changing, random teleportation, or even a Wither tearing its way into our universe right next to someone. Be careful, my friend...

# Quest.253 - Turning Liquids Into Essentia
gtnh.quest253.name=Turning Liquids Into Essentia
gtnh.quest253.desc=What a simple idea. So many people waste tons of buckets just to get aqua from water, or sano from milk. Why didn't they just dissolve the liquid itself? Idiots...

# Quest.254 - Essentia Filtering
gtnh.quest254.name=Essentia Filtering
gtnh.quest254.desc=This nifty little device will filter essentia out of an Alchemical Crucible or Alchemical Boiler. Once it has received a single unit of any type, it will only accept this type until it is completely empty. You can place more than one on top of an alchemical furnace, and you should. Try to have one per essentia type in the item you're melting on a furnace.%n%nYou should lock the type with a Label, or every time it fills again, it's likely to be a different type, and gum up your pipes.

# Quest.255 - An Alternative to Torches
gtnh.quest255.name=An Alternative to Torches
gtnh.quest255.desc=And lava! It's an excellent magical light source. You can use it under your crucible, too! But not your witchery stuff. :(

# Quest.256 - Not Coal
gtnh.quest256.name=Not Coal
gtnh.quest256.desc=Way better. More than Lignite even. It even speeds up the dissolving of items in an alchemical furnace.

# Quest.257 - Save the Squids, We Must
gtnh.quest257.name=Save the Squids, We Must
gtnh.quest257.desc=A very convenient way to make PETA activists happy and get ink at the same time. %n%nHint: The essentia in those roses might be useful...

# Quest.258 - Infinite... Lava?
gtnh.quest258.name=Infinite... Lava?
gtnh.quest258.desc=Well, it does need some ignis centi-vis, but hey, it's free. Also, expensive.

# Quest.259 - Infinite Water!
gtnh.quest259.name=Infinite Water!
gtnh.quest259.desc=The struggle is over. You've finally discovered a way to get infinite amounts of water.

# Quest.260 - Adept Thaumaturgy
gtnh.quest260.name=Adept Thaumaturgy
gtnh.quest260.desc=I have mastered the basics. Master warned me about forbidden magic, but it sounds so promising. I think a bit of the forbidden can't hurt...

# Quest.261 - An Awesome Magic Conductor
gtnh.quest261.name=An Awesome Magic Conductor
gtnh.quest261.desc=These tears, WOW! I've never felt something so strong. Could it be? Could I make an even more powerful wand with these?

# Quest.262 - An Even Better Conductor?
gtnh.quest262.name=An Even Better Conductor?
gtnh.quest262.desc=More... I want MOOORE! There must be something even stronger than the hydra. Something older, more ancient.

# Quest.263 - A Silverwood Wand at Last
gtnh.quest263.name=A Silverwood Wand at Last
gtnh.quest263.desc=I tried to combine the lich bones I had with a silverwood rod. The result: A pile of ashes. It crumbled to dust within seconds. I need a better conductor. The hydra in the Twilight Forest has the ability to regrow an entire head! Her blood must contain a large amount of magic. I guess I need a bit of that to finally complete my silverwood wand.

# Quest.264 - Obsidian Rod
gtnh.quest264.name=Obsidian Rod
gtnh.quest264.desc=By using obsidian and some earth clusters, I'm able to create a magically infused rod, that will slowly recharge its own terra vis.

# Quest.265 - Creating a Better Wand
gtnh.quest265.name=Creating a Better Wand
gtnh.quest265.desc=This greatwood wand is nice, but it can only store 50 vis. Not enough to move nodes. My attempts to use silverwood failed, but I've come across other mundane materials that I could use to make a new wand core.

Activating the oven to show the interface screen, you will see an additional slot to the right of the fuel slot. Clay jars must be placed in this slot. If there are clay jars present when something is cooked, there is a chance a by-product will be captured in one of the jars. These by-products are important ingredients in other recipes. If there are no clay jars in the oven when something is cooked, no by-products will be produced.%n%nUpgrading an Oven%n%nAn oven can be upgraded by placing either a Fume Funnel or a Filtered Fume Funnel to the left and right of it. Each Fume Funnel will increase the cooking speed by and additional 10 percent (over a furnace) and increase the chance of a by-product being produced by and additional 25 percent for a Fume Funnel or 30 percent for a Filtered Fume Funnel.%n%nA fully upgraded oven will therefore cook at 130 percent speed (compared to a furnace) and have a chance of a by-product of 90 percent.

It is important to check that there is sufficient available power to perform a given rite or use a distillery, or certain kettle or cauldron recipes.%n%nThe maximum amount of power available is determined by how many natural items are in the vicinity of the altar: dirt, grass, trees, plants, etc. all contribute; stone and sand do not. The important thing is to have a diverse mix of different plants, trees and crops (plants from other mods are supported to an extent as well). Read a wiki for details.%n%nCertain objects (or foci), placed onto an altar, will boost the focusing capabilities of an altar, either improving the amount of magic it can focus, the rate at which it replenishes or the range it can distribute power. Only one of each type of item (skull, chalice, etc.) will have an effect. There may also be other less savory foci that dark magic practitioners could make use of.

It is made by placing a regular Cauldron in the world, and then using Anointing Paste on it.%n%nTo brew a potion, cast a ritual or create an item, the cauldron must first be filled with water. This can be achieved by using three buckets of water on it, pumping water into it using pipes, or by using a Dispenser containing a Brew of Endless Water.%n%nOnce a cauldron is full of water, it must boil. Lighting a fire beneath the cauldron is the only way for this to happen. Using a netherrack block will guarantee the fire does not go out, although if it does go out, it may be set to boil again without any consequences (unlike brewing in a Kettle!).%n%nWhen the water is boiling, ingredients may be added to the Cauldron (one after another), to create the desired effect. The book, Witches' Brews gives a complete overview of all ingredients and what they can do when added to a brew.

gtnh.quest336.name=Probably Usable For Soup
gtnh.quest336.desc=But its main purpose is to brew potions and infusions.%n%nA kettle must be set up in the correct way before it can be used. %n%nFirstly, a fire must be set under the kettle (netherrack is best for this, but wood will do just as well). %n%nNext the kettle must be filled. You can use pipes to automate this. %n%nThirdly, each of the six ingredients for the brew or infusion must be thrown into the kettle, one at a time (the liquid will change color according to the recipe being used). %n%nFinally, a glass bottle must be used on the kettle to bottle the resulting brew, this must be done multiple times depending on the recipe.%n%nIt is important to keep the fire going constantly while the recipe is being prepared, otherwise it will be ruined. Swirls coming from the kettle is a sign all is well, black smoke (and brown liquid) indicates the brew is ruined. When a brew is ruined, the kettle must be emptied with a glass bottle, or just filled with more water, and the whole process repeated.%n%nWhen a brew is complete, the liquid will be the color of the resulting brew and will splutter (in addition to white swirls).%n%nSome recipes will require magical energy from a nearby Altar before they are bottled. If the brew is bottled when insufficient energy is available, the brew will be ruined. Black swirls coming from the Kettle is a good sign there is not enough power. A kettle must be within 14 (to 16) blocks of an Altar in order to obtain power from it (it can obtain power only from a single altar).

gtnh.quest363.name=Gassy Bees
gtnh.quest363.desc=There is whole swarm of gas producing bees. Let's breed just one of them here.%n%n§3This is the starting point for many gas related bees. Maybe check out NEI to see what you can aim for.

# Quest.364 - Naga
gtnh.quest364.name=Naga
gtnh.quest364.desc=You don't like fighting bosses or you play on peaceful for whatever reason? Well you can still get Naga drops with this bee!

# Quest.365 - Insurgence
gtnh.quest365.name=Insurgence
gtnh.quest365.desc=Is your infusion very slow? And, alas, to resolve that you need a world accelerator. That probably causes a lot of lag.%n%nWell no longer! Try out the new Infusion Interceptor. Read more about it on the Thaumic Insurgence page in your Thaumonomicon.

gtnh.quest366.name=Lich
gtnh.quest366.desc=Lich bones without a boss fight.

# Quest.369 - Snowqueen
gtnh.quest369.name=Snowqueen

# Quest.373 - §6§lAn Industrial Mobfarm
gtnh.quest373.name=§6§lAn Industrial Mobfarm
gtnh.quest373.desc=§6§lExtreme Extermination Chamber§r is your new and probably the §lbest§r spawner/grinder, with this you are not only able to get drops without any §lTPS§r issues but also with style and §lextreme§r efficiency.%n%nOf course that depends on the quality of your sword, damage and looting are the only stats that matter (weapon is optional since structure requires spikes and if you want to use it you need to add §cULV§r input bus to the structure).%n%nIf normal drops aren't your thing then you can build blood magic ritual "Well of Suffering" on top of the multiblock (you still get items but at a very slow rate).%nAlso generates liquid xp (always 120L) and can spawn infernal mobs if possible (uses x8 power with every infernal spawn so you need to take into account that energy usage will spike once in a while so be prepared for that!).%n%n§lNotes:§r%nIn case of any problems with multiblock animation just use soldering iron on the machine to disable it.

# Quest.374 - That is not storage!
gtnh.quest374.name=That is not storage!
gtnh.quest374.desc=Caution! Use with utmost care! This cell does exactly what it says. It deletes everything you put on there. So better make sure you have precise control over what can actually go there.

# Quest.375 - Power, So Much Power!
gtnh.quest375.name=Power, So Much Power!
gtnh.quest375.desc=If only I could harness it... Well, hello there my friend. I need your help with a project of mine. I want to create an immense power source, but I have a few problems that I need to solve first. Will you help me? You'll be well rewarded.%n%n§3The quests to get items will trigger the next part once you hold the item in question.

# Quest.376 - I'm Hungry
gtnh.quest376.name=I'm Hungry
gtnh.quest376.desc=What... I work a lot! So get me some food please.

# Quest.377 - A Casing
gtnh.quest377.name=A Casing
gtnh.quest377.desc=I need something for the outer shell. Again, a crystal-based material would be best, because I like it shiny. I tested all crystals I know of and none of them met the requirements. I heard you have access to outer space? Can you try to find a suitable material while you're out there?

# Quest.378 - It Needs a Power Plug...
gtnh.quest378.name=It Needs a Power Plug...
gtnh.quest378.desc=Given the fact that I will be able to craft this device, it needs some kind of "plug" to get the power out. I need something to conduct immense amounts of power. I thought about superconductors, but they don't fit with the crystal casing material I have in mind. I need 2 different crystals, one for positive and one for negative charge.

# Quest.379 - I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest379.name=I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest379.desc=Opening the wormhole is one thing, but I need to stabilize it, so it doesn't harm anything. I guess I need something made of crystal. Why? Because I like it fancy. Find me a crystal-based, transparent material with immense power, would you?

# Quest.380 - A Problem that Matters
gtnh.quest380.name=A Problem that Matters
gtnh.quest380.desc=I need to open a wormhole. But for that, I need an immense gravitational field. One like those created upon the death of a massive star, a black hole. But I can't really "kill" a sun for this. I need to compress matter somehow... But... How? I think I may need a specialized machine for this, one that does not use explosions, as that won't get dense enough.

# Quest.381 - Fancy!
gtnh.quest381.name=Fancy!
gtnh.quest381.desc=Yes. Yes! That's it! Bring me more of this stuff! I probably need a lot of it...

# Quest.382 - Red and Blue
gtnh.quest382.name=Red and Blue

I need to update some of my machines, as these exotic components you got me damaged some of them already. Don't worry, I have a list here.%n%nSome of my circuits burned to a crisp while I was trying to measure the conductivity of these soul and life shards. I need better ones.%n%nGood lord, these mysterious crystals have eaten away my diamond grinding head! How could that happen? Can you get me a better one?%n%nDo you see that pile of Rhodium and Palladium over there? No? Neither do I. Because the machine was VAPORIZED! Good that you gave me 2 singularities, the first one... Well... Just get me a better casing, would you?%n%nIt seems, that the stabilizers need... stabilizing... But I'm out of field generators. Can you help me with this?

# Quest.386 - §c§l[OUTDATED]§r Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.name=§c§l[OUTDATED]§r Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.desc=These ghosts are weird beings. But, I found this ectoplasm, which, by itself, seems to be pretty useless.

# Quest.387 - §c§l[OUTDATED]§r Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.name=§c§l[OUTDATED]§r Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.desc=By a random guess of yours, you combined molten ender pearls and a few more of these shards with an empty gem, and it turned blue. It is pulsating with power. You tried to use it on your containment device, and it seems to be able to bypass the force field, while keeping it intact that the same time. Sadly, it doesn't have enough power to let vis pass through. Maybe you can even further increase the gems power?

# Quest.388 - §6§lDraconic Evolution
gtnh.quest388.name=§6§lDraconic Evolution
gtnh.quest388.desc=You have tinkered long and hard to try to combine magic and technology. It looks like you finally found a way! Combining your powers as a thaumaturge and blood mage with your UHV technology you think you have found a way to distill the power of a dragon into a small core. This machine can do it, you are sure. If only you know how precisely to assembler such a core.%n%n%n§3Use a hologram projector to see how it is built. You can also upgrade your draconic cores but for that you need the higher tier schematics and you need to upgrade the multiblock.

# Quest.389 - §c§l[OUTDATED]§r Draconic evolution
gtnh.quest389.name=§c§l[OUTDATED]§r Draconic evolution
gtnh.quest389.desc=I found a way to combine technology and magic into something fantastic. A shiny blue emblem that emits immense amount of energy. I've decided to call it the draconic core. Make one for yourself!

# Quest.390 - Indium

# Quest.391 - Osmium
gtnh.quest391.name=Osmium
gtnh.quest391.desc=Quite the interesting bee. Maybe integrate it into your osmium processing?

gtnh.quest392.name=§c§l[OUTDATED]§r Activated teleport gem
gtnh.quest392.desc=You are sure that you've just discovered the solution for your containment problem. This gem happily transmits vis on request, while keeping the containment field intact. What a great day!

# Quest.393 - §c§l[OUTDATED]§r You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.name=§c§l[OUTDATED]§r You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.desc=Now that you are able to contain the activated draconium dust for an infinite amount of time, you where able to assure the energy it releases. The readings are incredible. You have never seen such a power before. The only problem is, the machinery required to keep the dust in this state is too large to use it for crafting.%n%nYou noticed something that might help: The dust reacts to vis, but it needs a lot of it, therefore you require the animation focus. If you could find a catalyst, that you can mix the dust with, you could make the dust react with the vis from its surroundings instead of a direct beam.

# Quest.394 - §c§l[OUTDATED]§r A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.name=§c§l[OUTDATED]§r A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.desc=That's it. This catalyst contains all primal energies in a quite different form, a lot weaker than any node. However, in combination with the draconium dust, it amplifies the vis that's around it, which leads to a permanent activation. It still needs to be contained, but you don't need the direct vis beam any more.%n%nThe result is a compound, which still emits massive amounts of power, but is less destructive. It still attacks the neutronium, but I think if I can find a capsule-like container that has special properties, I could create a portable version of it.

# Quest.395 - Dragon Blood
gtnh.quest395.name=Dragon Blood
gtnh.quest395.desc=The Dragon Blood Bee is a lot of effort to obtain but quite handy for hypogen in late game.

# Quest.396 - §c§l[OUTDATED]§r The final steps
gtnh.quest396.name=§c§l[OUTDATED]§r The final steps
gtnh.quest396.desc=Now that I've found a way to stabilize the draconium dust and keep it safe in a small capsule, I just need to make a small container for it, so I can drain the energy on demand. Neutronium will serve very well, but I need a magic conductor. Thaumium works, but gets way too hot and void metal has a bad conductivity. I need to find a high tier magic metal that is extremly strong and resillient, to a point where mundane materials could never get.

# Quest.397 - §c§l[OUTDATED]§r Endless evolution
gtnh.quest397.name=§c§l[OUTDATED]§r Endless evolution
gtnh.quest397.desc=Using your machine, you can now craft infinite amounts of these cores. And since it would be gruesome to let your golem work just for one single core, you decided to only request cores in a large batch of 16. How nice of you.

# Quest.398 - Kill Baba Yaga
gtnh.quest398.name=Kill Baba Yaga

gtnh.quest404.desc=Demons are powerful, evil beings who dwell in the infernal dimensions.

# Quest.462 - Wyvern Core
gtnh.quest462.name=Wyvern Core
gtnh.quest462.desc=Wyverns are rare dragons that can walk on two legs. More powerful for sure. Researching your Draconic Core, you found a way to improve it. The Wyvern Core.

# Quest.463 - Runes Tier 2
gtnh.quest463.name=Runes Tier 2
gtnh.quest463.desc=The speed rune is the only tier 2 rune. The speed rune does what its name implies, provides an additive 25% increase to the processing speed of the blood altar.%n%nHOWEVER, this makes it much more difficult to actually craft anything, so don't use them unless you're sure you can craft the item.

# Quest.464 - Draconic Core
gtnh.quest464.name=Draconic Core
gtnh.quest464.desc=Yes, this schematic is perfect! Whatever alien civilization this belonged to, it is exactly what you needed. Lets make a Draconic Core.%n%n%n§3You can find the schematic in a Pluto dungeon.

# Quest.465 - Chaotic Core
gtnh.quest465.name=Chaotic Core
gtnh.quest465.desc=In the darkest corners of the End you found a dragon that was different. Raw power streaming out in chaotic fashion, threatening to tear apart reality itself! But even that dragon you defeated. Concentrating that raw power within a core certainly isn't easy but it looks like you found a way.

# Quest.466 - Quantum Storage
gtnh.quest466.name=Quantum Storage
gtnh.quest466.desc=Now you §ocould§r connect Quantum Chests to your ME system with storage buses and maybe you are already doing that. But why not use all your new technology to make a Quantum storage cell?%n%nIt only takes a single item type, but you can store more than a billion items! That surely must be enough, right? RIGHT?

# Quest.467 - Awakened Core
gtnh.quest467.name=Awakened Core
gtnh.quest467.desc=There was something sleeping deep inside all the draconic material you have made and researched so far. It is time to AWAKE it!

# Quest.468 - A Digital Singularity
gtnh.quest468.name=A Digital Singularity
gtnh.quest468.desc=What? You filled up the Quantum storage cell? I hope with something better than Cobblestone. Anyway, you better make something EVEN bigger then.%n%nHmm, adding even more storage capacity to a single cell would result in something so dense in information that it would just collapse into a singularity. So why not be smart about it. Just use an already existing singularity! Build a sturdy casing around it and some connecting components and you should be good. Better use an eternal singularity though to make sure things remain stable.%n%n%n§3The Digital Singularity can store more than 4 quintillion items. If you manage to fill one up, please contact the dev team so that they can ban you for cheating, ... eh I mean §ocongratulate you on your achievement§r§3, of course!

# Quest.469 - §1§lCollecting Some Berries
gtnh.quest469.name=§1§lCollecting Some Berries
gtnh.quest469.desc=Are you waiting for the carrots to grow? Go and find some berry bushes and berries. The berries are a good source of food and you can put these bushes around your house to make a wall. It should provide a good protection against all those monsters that want to come into your house and kill you.

# Quest.470 - §1§lBerry Medley
gtnh.quest470.name=§1§lBerry Medley
gtnh.quest470.desc=Hmmm... what can you do with all those berries? Just eating? You will see that they have a very low saturation level. Let's plant the new berry bushes and mix the berries to make some better food.

# Quest.471 - §2§1§lFood Variants
gtnh.quest471.name=§2§1§lFood Variants
gtnh.quest471.desc=Maybe you noticed already that eating the same food too often is very boring and not healthy any more. Some food like tea leaf can be taken to the furnace and processed further. So take a break and drink a cup of tea. Maybe munch some tasty raisins as they are very nice.

# Quest.472 - §2§lYour First Tool
gtnh.quest472.name=§2§lYour First Tool
gtnh.quest472.desc=When your tinkers tables are ready you can craft your first §oreal§r tool. If you didn't find a village yet (to grab some parts from the chest), you can only craft flint tools.%n%nLet's start with a pickaxe, an axe and a shovel. At this point swords are unobtainable since they need metals like iron or bronze which you will get at a later stage. In the meantime use your gregtech swords.%n%nYour new tools are weak at first, but the more you use them the better they will get. You get a modifer slot after some levels, needing more as you level it up. They will level up to level 99 if you play long enough, with 20 modifier slots. Tool parts can be replaced for a bit of level XP, however the tool must be fully repaired first.%n%nYou need to level up the mining level each time you replace the parts to unleash the full power of the pickaxe. Stone->Copper for this pickaxe. If you manage to get a Zombie, Skeleton, or Creeper head, you can use it to skip the level-up process. This doesn't use up a modifier level, but does change the look until you change the pickaxe part out.%n%nItem=Usable when mining level is X or less%nZombie=1%nSkeleton=2%nCreeper=4%nWither Skeleton=7%nNether Star=8%n%n§3You can use paper binding to add extra modifier, but not very much important as tool level exists.

# Quest.473 - §2§lMaking a Better Sword
gtnh.quest473.name=§2§lMaking a Better Sword
gtnh.quest473.desc=Now it's time to make your first tinkers sword. First you have to make a blade, a type of guard, and tool rod cast forms. Melt some bronze in the smeltery and cast your tool parts. Tadaa... your first tinkers sword. There are 4 types of guard, changing them gets you a different sword type, see the tinker's book for details.

# Quest.474 - §2§k§l§l§r§2§lUpgrade 2.0
gtnh.quest474.name=§2§k§l§l§r§2§lUpgrade 2.0
gtnh.quest474.desc=Find iron, copper and tin ore. Very funny... How can you mine these with just a flint pickaxe?%n%nI have an idea; bring me some of the stone you mined with your flint pickaxe and I will give you a better tool head in exchange.%n%n§3Remember to level it up again!

# Quest.475 - §6§lHSS-G Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest475.name=§6§lHSS-G Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest475.desc=To process more advanced materials like HSS-E, HSS-S and naquadah you need more than 4500K. Time to upgrade your EBF to 5400k.

# Quest.476 - §6§lNaquadah Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest476.name=§6§lNaquadah Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest476.desc=To process more advanced materials like naquadah alloy you need more than 6300K. Upgrade your EBF to 7200k to increase the heat.

# Quest.477 - §6§lNaquadah Alloy Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest477.name=§6§lNaquadah Alloy Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest477.desc=This one is optional now. But still very useful and recommended.

# Quest.478 - §3§lFlint and Steel
gtnh.quest478.name=§3§lFlint and Steel
gtnh.quest478.desc=After you make steel you are able to craft flint and steel. I guess you'll want to travel to the Nether as soon as possible but be aware; the Nether is a very dangerous place.%n%nNote: The ball of moss gives a tinker's tool self-repair. But if the tool is completely broken, it won't repair it.%n%nNote that the flint and steel can take a few times to work.

# Quest.479 - §3§m§l§m§4§3§lTHE NETHER
gtnh.quest479.name=§3§m§l§m§4§3§lTHE NETHER
gtnh.quest479.desc=Now more dangerous with extra hardcore infernal mobs. Have fun and take care. Remember that the flint and steel can take a few times to work, but there are other ways to make fire ...%n%nBe sure to bring a tough companion along to keep you alive. If you have no friends, why not make an Iron Golem and push it through first, or bring the materials for more along with you?%n%nAlso, §lwhen§r you die here, not if, your graves will spawn skeletons because of the darkness. Make sure you light up areas where you might die, and when recovering graves light up the area §lfirst§r so that you don't end up dying over and over and making a mess.%n%nWatch out for some mobs! They'll take minimal damage from any weapon that is not their weakness. So if you seem to not be doing much damage, you probably aren't! Think about other options to hurt/kill the monster.

# Quest.480 - §2§lMalachite
gtnh.quest480.name=§2§lMalachite
gtnh.quest480.desc=Another copper source is "malachite" which can be found between Y 10-40. This vein contains more iron ore variants like "brown limonite", "yellow limonite" and "banded iron ore".%n%n§4Hint:%nTo see where a special ore can be found click the raw ore in nei and it will show you more details. Works with small ores too.

# Quest.481 - §l§2§lCreosote
gtnh.quest481.name=§l§2§lCreosote
gtnh.quest481.desc=I guess you already processed a bit of wood into charcoal and wonder what you can do with all this creosote?%n%nWell you can burn it in a normal furnace to cook your food or you can make more torches with it. Later in the LV age you can run combustion generators with it, but it's super inefficient. It works better in the RC boiler instead.

# Quest.482 - §2§lAnimal Farms
gtnh.quest482.name=§2§lAnimal Farms
gtnh.quest482.desc=Trying to get some leather or wool? You'd probably need to spend a lot of time hunting animals and traveling around, or you could simply make a farm to get a decent amount of leather, wool and meat close to home. Make sure you don't put too many animals in the pen or they will overcrowd and kill each other (this happens to villagers as well).%n%nAnimals will prioritize moving towards grass blocks over any other blocks, and if there's no grass blocks around, lit blocks over dark blocks. You can encourage animals to stay in pens (or at least not crowd the edges) by removing grass from around both sides of the fence (and under!) and placing a torch in the center of the pen. For sheep that need the grass to eat (reduces time to mature and replaces sheared wool instantly), place it in the center of a cleared out area with a border of non-grass.%n%nAlso, large quantities can cause server lag, especially if they are bumping into each other a lot. So make sure you limit animals to no more than ~ 1 per block for small entities like chickens and 1 entity per 2 blocks for large entities like cows if playing MP.%n%n§3PS: Mutton amount was reduced because apparently mutton and calamari (from squid) drops are extremely low on servers for some reason. Remember to use your butchery knife.%n%nPPS: Most animal/mob drops can be gotten from less laggy IC2 crop farms.

# Quest.483 - §2§lGardener
gtnh.quest483.name=§2§lGardener
gtnh.quest483.desc=If you were wondering: Why do I never get seeds when destroying grass? Because. Use your new mattock on the grass blocks that do not have water anywhere nearby to find some seeds.

# Quest.484 - §1§lCan You Hear the Carrots Grow?
gtnh.quest484.name=§1§lCan You Hear the Carrots Grow?
gtnh.quest484.desc=Tired of waiting since your carrots grow sooooo slow?%n%nWell I've got an idea, bone meal will help you grow food in seconds. So, chop down some trees and I will trade you some bone meal.

# Quest.485 - §2§lYou Need MOOOOOOORE Wood
gtnh.quest485.name=§2§lYou Need MOOOOOOORE Wood
gtnh.quest485.desc=It's time to feed your new coke oven with some wood to get more charcoal. You're looking for the most efficient way to plant trees. Try to find some spruce saplings and some jungle saplings. Both can be planted in a 2x2 grid to get bigger trees.%n%n§3PS: I have no idea why this quest asks you for something, and then gives you a reward that makes it obselete immediately.%n%nhint: you can buy them with coins.

# Quest.486 - §2§lTanned Leather
gtnh.quest486.name=§2§lTanned Leather
gtnh.quest486.desc=You have found a way to make leather more durable and resistant by further processing it. Make some bound leather from four pieces of leather, some strings and woven cotton. Now you only have to hang it on a drying rack and wait about 10 minutes to get some tanned leather. Stockpile some for later.

# Quest.487 - §2§lNeed More Space?
gtnh.quest487.name=§2§lNeed More Space?
gtnh.quest487.desc=As you might know: tanned leather is more resistant and good enough for a backpack. Let's get a digger's backpack and a miner's backpack. Each pack holds different items. So use both for your first true back-packed mining experience.

# Quest.488 - §2§lYou Need Them All!
gtnh.quest488.name=§2§lYou Need Them All!
gtnh.quest488.desc=There are many more backpacks: Hunter, builder, forester...

# Quest.489 - §2§lA Better Lunch Bag
gtnh.quest489.name=§2§lA Better Lunch Bag
gtnh.quest489.desc=Your lunch bag is now abused and rather old so it's time to get something better. Let's craft a lunch box which can hold way more food.

# Quest.490 - Obscenely Dangerous Nuclear Fuel: The Core
gtnh.quest490.name=Obscenely Dangerous Nuclear Fuel: The Core
gtnh.quest490.desc=For the truly insane mad scientists out there. Or people who can read a website (not guaranteed, trust me!). You HAVE to use coolant cells with it if you want power or to have it not explode after 1s.

# Quest.491 - §2§lSleeping Outside
gtnh.quest491.name=§2§lSleeping Outside
gtnh.quest491.desc=Carrying the bed with you all the time the looks very funny. Why don't you craft a sleeping bag to stay outside without placing a bed and changing your spawn point. This way if you die, you'll be right at home!

# Quest.492 - §2§lSheep Hairdresser
gtnh.quest492.name=§2§lSheep Hairdresser
gtnh.quest492.desc=Killing sheep to get the wool is so inefficient. Making some shears would make sense if you need more wool.

# Quest.493 - §3§lWiremill v0.2 Alpha
gtnh.quest493.name=§3§lWiremill v0.2 Alpha
gtnh.quest493.desc=Small gears require a wire cutter to be made, so let's craft one.

# Quest.494 - §2§lRedstone
gtnh.quest494.name=§2§lRedstone
gtnh.quest494.desc=If you didn't find any Redstone veins yet, it is quite important to look for one now. Try your luck at Y 5-40.

# Quest.495 - §3§lOoo, Shiny! (Not Platinum!)
gtnh.quest495.name=§3§lOoo, Shiny! (Not Platinum!)
gtnh.quest495.desc=To make your first macerator you need two diamonds, and to enter the Twilight Forest you need one. Finding a diamond vein would help you a lot. Go and look for one at Y 5-20.

# Quest.496 - §3§lHow to Make Rubber
gtnh.quest496.name=§3§lHow to Make Rubber
gtnh.quest496.desc=Making rubber is now more complicated - you need raw rubber and sulfur. Finding a sulfur vein in the Nether seems like a good idea, doesn't it? Found on Y 5-20. Later on you can get sulfur from chemicals like hydrogren sulfide or pyrite.%n%n§4Sphalerite will be important later for gallium and zinc. Save it until you can fully process it in LV.

# Quest.497 - §4§3§lLit Way to Get Charred
gtnh.quest497.name=§4§3§lLit Way to Get Charred
gtnh.quest497.desc=You have found an alternative way of making charcoal with a "charcoal pile igniter". %nGo and start getting massive amounts of charcoal.

# Quest.498 - §2§lXP Usage?!
gtnh.quest498.name=§2§lXP Usage?!
gtnh.quest498.desc=Exploring some dungeons or fighting mobs probably gave you a lot of XP. Better use it to get iron, copper, tin or other useful dusts before you die during the next fight.%n%nPlace your tank on the ground and a drain on top. Now you can fill it with XP.%n%nBy the way, you discovered that while the seared tank doesn't hold much, it doesn't lose contents when broken, and full tanks can stack. I wonder if that information is useful...

# Quest.499 - Diesel, creosote: Watch them BURN!
gtnh.quest499.name=Diesel, creosote: Watch them BURN!
gtnh.quest499.desc=You have almost made it. One last crafting step is required in order to advance to tier 2. Keep going!

# Quest.500 - First Things First
gtnh.quest500.name=First Things First
gtnh.quest500.desc=As usual. In order to get started with bees, you need a few basic things. Most importantly... a scoop. For this quest you want to make a GregTech scoop. Later you can make scoops using magic or even rechargeable scoops.

# Quest.501 - Go Find Some Bees
gtnh.quest501.name=Go Find Some Bees
gtnh.quest501.desc=The next thing to do: Find a few bee hives around the world. There are 11 mundane bees that can be found, of which 8 are located in the Overworld. Any kind of bee will work for this quest.

# Quest.502 - A New Home
gtnh.quest502.name=A New Home
gtnh.quest502.desc=Now that you've destroyed the poor bees' homes, you should build them a new one. The humble Bee House will not let your bees mutate into new species. But you'll need the combs anyways for better housing. The production rate isn't too bad, but they cannot be automated.%n%nOne tip - Put some vanilla saplings near the Bee Houses. Bee Houses give a natural boost of 3x to pollination vs better housing. The bees will pollinate them and you might get lucky and start getting some Forestry tree crossbreeding. Stick with Oak and Birch trees, they'll give you a nice mix of starter Forestry trees.%n%nOf course, if you do this without taking precautions, you may find yourself swarmed by laggy butterflies...%n%nYou may also notice that bees with the 'flower' type flower spread flowers. This can be used to get, say, lavender, among others. If you don't like them spreading them everywhere, replace the dirt/grass blocks, remove the trait, or reduce the pollination speed/territory.

# Quest.503 - Analyze Them All
gtnh.quest503.name=Analyze Them All
gtnh.quest503.desc=Every bee has multiple properties that define what the bee does, how it behaves in rain or at night, and a couple of other aspects. It is mandatory to keep track of those properties. This kit isn't very good since it doesn't give you information on their Inactive attributes, but waste not, want not.%n%nYou'll need to use paper to analyze each bee.

# Quest.504 - To Scan or Not to Scan
gtnh.quest504.name=To Scan or Not to Scan
gtnh.quest504.desc=In order to get into bee breeding, you need a way to see all the traits, active and inactive. You only want to breed so called "pure" bees; For those, both "Active" and "Inactive" traits are identical.%n%n§3BTW, it's not like the more 'advanced' versions are actually better, just that they have more functions. Use the one you like.

# Quest.505 - Top-Tier Analyser
gtnh.quest505.name=Top-Tier Analyser
gtnh.quest505.desc=The best you can get, for all your scanning and analysing needs.

# Quest.506 - To Play God
gtnh.quest506.name=To Play God
gtnh.quest506.desc=In order to continue with bees, to mutate and breed them as you like, you need mutagen. This greenish, smelly liquid needs to be refined from bacterial sludge that seems to be available only on Mars. You will be able to continue, once you've arrived there.%n%nIn the meantime you can start working with the Genetics mod, since we all know Gendustry is too easy... Check out the recipes and you'll understand why you should look into the Genetics mod.%n%n§3Make sure to make more with the Vat once you can actually make it.

# Quest.507 - Upgraded Home
gtnh.quest507.name=Upgraded Home
gtnh.quest507.desc=The Bee House can be used to stabilize mutations, for example if you have successfully bred two different bees, but the passive traits are different from the active ones. %n%nTo actually breed those together to get a new species, you'll need something different - the Apiary. Building them will require a Carpenter and Impregnated frames, along with Seed Oil and Creosote - quite a bit of industrialization! Or, if you're lucky, you can find a beekeeper villager to trade with. Maybe you can help the villagers §lget lucky§r to make more beekeeper villagers? If only Cupid and his bow were around...%n%nProduction rates in an empty Apiary are low - lower than a Bee House by quite a bit, in fact.  But the Apiary has two big advantages - Frames, and Automation. You can now use your Untreated or Impregnated frames in here to boost output - and the boost is multiplied. So 3 x2 frames gives you 2 * 2 * 2 = 8x extra output! You can also automate I/O for the bees and their products, though not frames unfortunately.%n%nBees also don't live as long as in a Bee House, but that's actually a good thing.%n%nAlso, you should check the Genetics mod for useful machines. The Acclimatiser can give very picky bees a much wider temperature or humidity tolerance without having to breed it into them.

# Quest.508 - Mutatron
gtnh.quest508.name=Mutatron
gtnh.quest508.desc=Mutations can be boring, they can be annoying, and most times, they are frustrating. With this machine, you will get a 100 percent pure bred mutation. If the combination of princess and drone can result in multiple mutations, the outcome is random. But who cares?%n%n§3You can now upgrade your leftover Bees Advanced bags to Bees Expert in the last quest tab.%n%nIf you missed grabbing an effect from a species, this is a way to get it again.%n%nYou'll need naquadah bees to make this, and the other Gendustry machines.

# Quest.509 - Genetic Sampler
gtnh.quest509.name=Genetic Sampler
gtnh.quest509.desc=With this machine, you can extract a random trait from any bee, sapling, butterfly or flower. The bee/sapling/butterfly/flower will be destroyed in this process. Each process requires an empty gene sample and some labware.%n%nThe resulting sample is random, so make sure to recycle the extra gene samples you don't want.

# Quest.510 - Diamondware
gtnh.quest510.name=Diamondware
gtnh.quest510.desc=Also known as labware. Be prepared. In order to do serious bee-work, you need stacks of diamonds. I'm not joking, stacks! Better start working on that diamond bee!

# Quest.511 - Genetic Imprinter
gtnh.quest511.name=Genetic Imprinter
gtnh.quest511.desc=With this powerful machine, you can inject gene samples, which allows you to alter any aspect of your bee, tree or butterfly. The gene sample (or pattern) will not be destroyed. The success rate is 100%, and one labware is consumed per injection.

# Quest.512 - Genetic Transposer
gtnh.quest512.name=Genetic Transposer
gtnh.quest512.desc=DNA samples of species and/or traits are pretty valuable. You always should keep at least one of each gene sample you get your hand on in a chest somewhere safe. By using this machine, you are able to copy any gene sample, for the cost of an empty serum vial and some labware.%n%n§3You don't actually need to keep all of them if you don't intend to use them of course.

# Quest.513 - Advanced Mutatron
gtnh.quest513.name=Advanced Mutatron
gtnh.quest513.desc=A more advanced version of the mutatron. It uses more energy to mutate a drone with a princess, and you can select which mutation you want to have. This machine is a must-have for high-tier bees.%n%n§3You'll need neutronium bees to make this.

# Quest.514 - Blank Gene Samples
gtnh.quest514.name=Blank Gene Samples
gtnh.quest514.desc=To get the various traits from a bee, you need a lot of power, labware and an empty gene sample. You don't need a lot of those, as you can just throw them in a furnace to remove remaining DNA of traits you don't need or want. %n%nIn the meantime you can start working with the Genetics mod, since we all know Gendustry is too easy... Genetics is used for bees, trees, and Botany flowers so it gets its own quest tab. Gendustry is really good for bees, but will require top tier equipment.

# Quest.515 - Genetic Template
gtnh.quest515.name=Genetic Template
gtnh.quest515.desc=Templates are used to combine multiple gene samples into one large batch. It can be used to apply multiple traits at once, but you can also replicate a bee from liquid DNA and protein, if you manage to fill all 13 traits in one template. These templates can also be copied, just like the small samples.

# Quest.516 - A Rather Cruel Disposal
gtnh.quest516.name=A Rather Cruel Disposal
gtnh.quest516.desc=You'll probably end up with a lot of excess drones while doing bees. (Or saplings if you do trees). Instead of throwing them away, you could also turn them into... something useful.

# Quest.517 - Arnie's Blender
gtnh.quest517.name=Arnie's Blender
gtnh.quest517.desc=They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. This machine turns raw meat into liquid protein, which is used to create bees from scratch. Which has §oabsolutely§  nothing§r to do with breakfast.

# Quest.518 - And There Shall be Light
gtnh.quest518.name=And There Shall be Light
gtnh.quest518.desc=Out of princesses to inject traits to? Too lazy to find hives and get more bees? Not a problem. With this nifty little device, you can use a ton of power, liquid DNA and protein to create any bee you wish to have. The only drawback is: All bees will be ignoble, which means they will die after a random amount of cycles after 90.%n%nOf course, there's an upgrade for the industrial apiary to deal with that

# Quest.519 - Only the Best: Temperature
gtnh.quest519.name=Only the Best: Temperature

# Quest.530 - §5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #6
gtnh.quest530.name=§5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #6
gtnh.quest530.desc=The sixth item you'll need a lot of. For the scanner and the seismic prospector.%n%n§3BTW, there's technically one more, the Field Generator, but you need higher tier circuits to make it, and it isn't used as often until later tiers.

# Quest.531 - §5§lScanning Bees, Crops and Moooooore!
gtnh.quest531.name=§5§lScanning Bees, Crops and Moooooore!
gtnh.quest531.desc=Automate your bee, sapling, or crop scanning. Later on, this machine gets very useful for scanning high tier machine parts for the assembly line research data or to fill data orbs with data for UUMatter production. Data sticks with raw prospecting data need a scanner too.

# Quest.532 - §5§lExploding Fluids For Power
gtnh.quest532.name=§5§lExploding Fluids For Power
gtnh.quest532.desc=The Combustion Generator produces EU from several fluids. Some are more popular than others, but the Oil processing line has a different combustion fluid in every tier from LV to EV, and all of them are burned in these generators.%n%nTo start, LV is the tier of Light Fuel. It is worth much more than the Oil itself for generating power, so you should distill and dessulfurize the Oil to get clean Light Fuel and use it for power. It's a great way to run your base, and can be upgraded further in the next tiers. Check the "Working with Oil" tab for more information, once you've made a Pump and found some Oil.%n%n§3If you're dealing with Oil processing, this is the type of generator you'll use the most.§r

# Quest.533 - §4§5§lHydrogen, Methane or Some Farts... (Natural gas) 
gtnh.quest533.name=§4§5§lHydrogen, Methane or Some Farts... (Natural gas) 
gtnh.quest533.desc=Some centrifugal processes leave gases behind like Hydrogen or Methane. Centrifuge some Brown and Yellow Limonite to get Hydrogen or dump your unused food in a Centrifuge to get Methane gas. Wood will even give 60 mb per log, and many other crops will also generate Methane this way.%n%nThe main powergen line that uses this generator is Benzene, but that needs MV tier.%n%n§3If you're dealing with fully renewable powergen, this is the type of generator you'll use the most.

# Quest.534 - §4§3§lPollution What....?
gtnh.quest534.name=§4§3§lPollution What....?
gtnh.quest534.desc=If you are running your bricked blast furnace for a long time you will sometimes get headaches, nausea and other weird effects. Yes this is pollution... from making so much steel. If you can collect some rubber sheets, I will trade you a complete hazmat suit.

# Quest.535 - §1§2§lRedstone, Early Game Processing
gtnh.quest535.name=§1§2§lRedstone, Early Game Processing
gtnh.quest535.desc=Are you wondering how to process redstone without a macerator? Well you can mine it with a gregtech hammer (you can place the ore you got back down to do this) and get the crushed ore. Then use the hammer in the crafting table to get some impure redstone dust. After this, fill a cauldron with water and drop the dust in it - CTRL-Q drops a whole stack, which the cauldron can handle for the same amount of water. You will get pure redstone dust for your redstone needs.

# Quest.536 - §4§3§lRubber Sheets
gtnh.quest536.name=§4§3§lRubber Sheets
gtnh.quest536.desc=Let's make a mold for the rubber sheets. You can use them for cables. They are also needed for conveyors, a plunger, and some more recipes.

# Quest.538 - §5§lBasic Ore Washer
gtnh.quest538.name=§5§lBasic Ore Washer
gtnh.quest538.desc=Macerating ores usually doubles the output. If you want MOOOOOOORE, craft an ore washer and wash out some rare materials.%n%nNote that these both use water, and are painfully slow.%n%n§3PS, use crushed ore.

# Quest.539 - §5§lRound and Round and Round...
gtnh.quest539.name=§5§lRound and Round and Round...
gtnh.quest539.desc=After purification of your ore dust, you can centrifuge it to get even more byproducts out of the dust.

# Quest.540 - §5§lA Truly Sharp Saw Blade
gtnh.quest540.name=§5§lA Truly Sharp Saw Blade
gtnh.quest540.desc=Combining cobalt brass and diamond dust makes a really sharp saw blade for your cutting machine.%n%n§3BTW, this is the only use for cobalt brass in the game, pretty pointless, yeah?

# Quest.541 - §5§lA New Alloy - Cobalt Brass
gtnh.quest541.name=§5§lA New Alloy - Cobalt Brass
gtnh.quest541.desc=If you want to cut diamond blocks into plates, it's time to get a new alloy, Cobalt Brass.%n%nFirst you need to make brass out of zinc (only found in small ores in the Overworld, in Nether Sphalerite, or as a centrifuge byproduct from tin or tetrahedrite) and copper. Mix it with aluminium and cobalt dust (you can get it as a byproduct of a couple ores, go searching in the nether, or go to the Twilight Forest for Cobaltite) to get the cobalt brass dust.%n%nNow that you've come this far, we think that you're able to look up the ores that you need by yourself with the help of NEI.

# Quest.542 - §5§lElectrically Separating Dusts
gtnh.quest542.name=§5§lElectrically Separating Dusts

gtnh.quest543.desc=Want to make some cetane-boosted diesel, plastic or some chemical dyes? Then it's time to craft a chemical reactor.%n%n§3You can use the battery slot and the other extra slot in the GUI to store unused configuration circuits.

# Quest.544 - §5§lCompact? Or is it?
gtnh.quest544.name=§5§lCompact? Or is it?
gtnh.quest544.desc=It's a compressor but that doesn't mean it's compact... %n%n§3It is highly recommended to get one of these electric compressors, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to compress something is a lot better when using EU.

# Quest.545 - §3§5§lSuction Device... Nice
gtnh.quest545.name=§3§5§lSuction Device... Nice
gtnh.quest545.desc=I hope you're not thinking about what I'm thinking you're thinking about... %n%n§3It is highly recommended to get one of these, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to extracting something is a lot better when using EU.

# Quest.546 - §5§lHello Baron, How's Your Black Gold Today?
gtnh.quest546.name=§5§lHello Baron, How's Your Black Gold Today?
gtnh.quest546.desc=During your travels you may have seen some huge oil spouts. Now's the time to make a pump and go collect this black gold into tanks. Oil can be burned directly in a combustion generator (onsite to power the pump, perhaps?) or be refined for better fuels and crafting materials. %n%nBring a generator or battery buffer (with full batteries obviously) with you to power the pump. Thanks to the advancement of technology the pump can auto output on top. Stacking multiple pumps makes them work faster. In that case, oil has to be removed from the bottom of the stack using a pump cover or other means like a conduit.%n%nTaller spouts have more oil. But for the LV pump, it's better to use the short spouts if possible since it doesn't have enough range to fully collect the larger ones in the horizontal range. Save the taller spouts for MV or HV pumps.%n%nMining pipes are needed for pumping the oil, same as the auto miner. When it hits the bottom (or something in the way), if there's no fluid left to collect, it will start retracting the pipes. Same thing if you disable it with a soft mallet. You can also change the range with a screwdriver if there's a reason to do that, like collecting lava in a limited area faster.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on all sides. And set a waypoint with JourneyMaps so you don't forget where you placed it!%n%n§3Once you run out of surface oil, you'll want to turn to:%n1) Oilsands ore, though this is better suited for making heavy oil%n2) Making oil from logs in a pyro%n4) Ridiculous bio vat nonsense%n5) Crops%n6) Bees%n7) The real answer, which is Underground or UG oil. Dims generally have a couple fluids that can be accessed with a multiblock version of the pump, available in MV+. Go read the quest for it when it's available for details

# Quest.547 - §5§lYour Oil is Too Crude? Refine it!
gtnh.quest547.name=§5§lYour Oil is Too Crude? Refine it!
gtnh.quest547.desc=Burning oil in the combustion generator is a very inefficient way of producing power. Every bucket/cell of oil only gives you 20,000 EU. Time to refine it.%n%nYou'll need to use a circuit to pick which of the products you want. Later on you can make a Distillation Tower to get all of them, but that's far away for now.

# Quest.548 - §5§lLight Sulfuric Fuel
gtnh.quest548.name=§5§lLight Sulfuric Fuel
gtnh.quest548.desc=You can distill your oil into light sulfuric fuel, that has a burn value of 40,000 EU.

# Quest.549 - §5§lLight Fuel
gtnh.quest549.name=§5§lLight Fuel
gtnh.quest549.desc=By adding Hydrogen to Sulfuric Light Fuel in a Chemical Reactor you can produce Light Fuel with the very high burn value of 305,000 EU per cell. It is also the main component of Diesel, an excellent fuel that becomes available in MV%n%nThe remaining Hydrogen Sulfide can be used to produce Sulfuric Acid for, well, tons of stuff. You can never have enough of it! You can also crack Light Fuel in a Chemical Reactor and then distill it to get Ethylene, for Polyethylene.

# Quest.550 - §5§lH for Hydrogen... the Rest of the Alphabet is Too Complicated...
gtnh.quest550.name=§5§lH for Hydrogen... the Rest of the Alphabet is Too Complicated...
gtnh.quest550.desc=Centrifuge some brown or yellow limonite dust, or use an Electrolyser with water to get some hydrogen.%n%nThere are many other ways of obtaining hydrogen which you might want to look into. Some are only available much later.%n%nExamples are: chemical processing or electrolysis of methane obtained from organic sources, electrolysis of water or salt water, mixing sodium with water, or eventually siphoning hydrogen directly from a gas giant.

# Quest.551 - §5§lHeavy Sulfuric Fuel
gtnh.quest551.name=§5§lHeavy Sulfuric Fuel
gtnh.quest551.desc=You can distill your oil into heavy sulfuric fuel, that has a burn value of 40,000 EU.

# Quest.552 - §5§lHeavy Fuel
gtnh.quest552.name=§5§lHeavy Fuel
gtnh.quest552.desc=By adding Hydrogen to sulfuric Heavy Fuel in a Chemical Reactor you can produce Heavy Fuel, with a burn value of 240,000 EU per cell! Aside from this, it's also required for Diesel, in MV, which is a better fuel, and it can also be distilled into three very useful fluids: Benzene, Toluene and Phenol.%n%nIt's honestly not especially efficient to make Heavy Fuel out of regular Oil. You should try to get Heavy Oil to make it, like from Oilsands Ore in MV once you can. Then use it to make Diesel.

# Quest.553 - §6§lDiesel Fuel
gtnh.quest553.name=§6§lDiesel Fuel
gtnh.quest553.desc=If you get an MV mixer, you can mix your light and heavy fuel together to give diesel. At 480,000 per cell, this turns 1,525,000 EU into 2,880,000, not accounting for how much you spent to get it, so it's definitely worth it.

# Quest.554 - §5§lHey DJ, Mix it!
gtnh.quest554.name=§5§lHey DJ, Mix it!
gtnh.quest554.desc=The mixer is a very useful device. You can mix all kinds of fluids and items. Useful to prevent dust from falling to the ground when crafting - most mixer recipes give a slight boost over hand crafting!%n%n§3You get +3 slots in the EV+ versions, this one has 6.%n%n§3Hint: You can use the battery slot and other extra slots in the GUI to store anything you like!

# Quest.555 - §5§lN Like Nitrogen... Hide, the Alphabet Strikes Again!
gtnh.quest555.name=§5§lN Like Nitrogen... Hide, the Alphabet Strikes Again!
gtnh.quest555.desc=You can get some nitrogen by centrifuging... air. This process takes a long time, especially at LV tier.%n%nYou get that air from compressed air cells, which are gotten from running cells through a compressor. Each one contains 2000L, unlike a normal cell that contains 1000L.

# Quest.557 - §9§lNITRO! (Cetane-Boosted Diesel)
gtnh.quest557.name=§9§lNITRO! (Cetane-Boosted Diesel)
gtnh.quest557.desc=1,000,000 EU per cell, way more dense than before. Yes, yes, this is very good! Make some cetane-boosted diesel fuel and power your Combustion Engine with it.%n%n§3BTW HOG is a different path, so you'll need to completely redo your setup if you want that in EV.

# Quest.558 - §3§lHow Can I Carry All These Items?
gtnh.quest558.name=§3§lHow Can I Carry All These Items?
gtnh.quest558.desc=After you make your first steel you're able to craft the small backpack. In this bag you can put a lot of the stuff you want to carry around. With 36 slots it's a bit bigger than a small chest. Later you can make it even larger. You can put one on your back and set it to automatically pick up stuff. %n%n§4Check out the "Backpacks" control configuration "Open Backpacks" and remap it to a new key.%n%nThe key binding only works after the backpack is added to the back slot, which can be done using Shift+<Open Backpacks Key>.%n%n§4The maximum you can have in your inventory at once is 4.

# Quest.559 - §6§lLow-Pressure Boiler Tank
gtnh.quest559.name=§6§lLow-Pressure Boiler Tank
gtnh.quest559.desc=The low pressure boiler tank is the easiest way to make steam with an RC boiler. The firebox needs this tank on top to produce steam. The bigger the boiler the slower it heats up, but it will produce more steam when heated up.%n%nExtract steam by attaching a pipe to the boiler tank.

# Quest.560 - §6§lRailcraft Steam Power
gtnh.quest560.name=§6§lRailcraft Steam Power
gtnh.quest560.desc=As an alternative way to make steam you can use the railcraft boilers. They require at least one firebox.%n%nMore than one size is possible: (1x1 which the quest gets you to make) 2x2 and 3x3.%n%nProvide water and coal to the firebox. Make sure you don't run out of water or...BOOM.%n%nEach boiler needs 1, 2 or 3 layers of tanks on top, equal to the size (1x1x1, 2x2x2, or 3x3x3) - see the quests linked below.

# Quest.561 - §6§lLiquid-Fuelled Firebox
gtnh.quest561.name=§6§lLiquid-Fuelled Firebox
gtnh.quest561.desc=Cresosote oil into steam! After you make your first steel you are able to craft a liquid fueled firebox.%n%nDiesel, ethanol, creosote and bio diesel all work well here. This will also require a boiler tank - see the quests linked below.

# Quest.562 - §6§lHigh-Pressure Boiler Tank
gtnh.quest562.name=§6§lHigh-Pressure Boiler Tank
gtnh.quest562.desc=After you make steel you are able to craft a high pressure boiler tank. The upgraded version increases the temperature and produces more steam than the low pressure version. It will take longer to warm up, so make sure to keep it well fed!%n%nExtract steam by attaching a pipe to the boiler tank.

# Quest.563 - Time to Kill (Wither Skeleton)
gtnh.quest563.name=Time to Kill (Wither Skeleton)
gtnh.quest563.desc=Gimme yo §oSkuuuuull!!!§r <-- The thought of every non-noob player upon seeing one.%n%nBTW, in case you didn't know, you can summon the Wither by placing 4 soul sand blocks in a T shape, with 3 wither skulls on top. Don't do so in your base.

gtnh.quest576.desc=A manual crafting table which remembers the last nine used recipes. Left click one of the recipes shown in the right-hand side to automatically fill in the crafting grid. Right-click to lock a memorized recipe and prevent a newer recipe from bumping it off.%n%nResources need to go into the internal inventory. The crafting matrix is only a visual representation.%n%nThe Forestry worktable is super-useful, and can reduce the tedium of many common jobs because you can click-drag across a row of items, and it will use tools in its own inventory to continue crafting.%n%nSpecifically:%nMaking <Item X> with <Bucket of Y> - Put all the ingredients into the table, and if the recipe is selected, shift click the result to craft them all at once (until you run out)%nMaking fresh water for Pam's - Same as above, but no second item%nMaking clay bricks - The wooden form is automatically reused%nMaking anything that uses a tool - Also automatically reused, while consuming durability%n%n§3For more forestry quests you need to go to the dedicated tab.

# Quest.577 - Forestry core block
gtnh.quest577.name=Forestry core block
gtnh.quest577.desc=This sturdy casing is the basis for almost all machines in Forestry, essentially being the forestry equivalent of a machine casing.

# Quest.578 - The Carpenter
gtnh.quest578.name=The Carpenter
gtnh.quest578.desc=The carpenter is similar to an automatic crafting table. It has an item input slot and a storage slot for the recipes. Some recipes need an additional fluid like water, creosote, honey or molten redstone. With the carpenter you can make farmblocks, woven backpacks, bee and tree analysers and many more.%n%nThe carpenter needs power to work. You can use a GT cable or a battery box to connect to the machine or make some forestry, railcraft or buildcraft RF engines.%n%n§3PS: Yes it's a pain in the ass to automate, just make one for each thing you want to make.

# Quest.579 - §5§lMolten Redstone?
gtnh.quest579.name=§5§lMolten Redstone?
gtnh.quest579.desc=You heard that the carpenter needs some molten redstone for a few recipes. Converting redstone dust into a fluid requires a fluid extractor. Let's build one.%n%nIf you want to get that molten redstone into a cell, you'll need a fluid canner instead of a GT tank. Why? Because Reasons.%n%nFortunately, most fluids work properly, but redstone, cracked fluids, and certain other ones do not. Or just use a universal cell.

# Quest.580 - Thermionic Fabricator
gtnh.quest580.name=Thermionic Fabricator
gtnh.quest580.desc=The thermionic fabricator is used to craft electron tubes and stained glass. It requires redstone flux (RF) energy to run.%n%nIt is your first machine made in the carpenter. Once warmed up, it needs to maintain a certain heat level to operate. The amount of power supplied will determine how much heat will be generated. If you do not supply enough power to maintain the current temperature it will slowly drop. It will continuously draw power, so disconnect it if you don't need it.

# Quest.581 - A Series of Tubes
gtnh.quest581.name=A Series of Tubes
gtnh.quest581.desc=Before you can craft your first farm block you need apatite tubes. Make some apatite rods first with a lathe, then use a forge hammer to join them into long apatite rods. You need golden bolts and a red alloy plate.%n%nPut some glass or sand into your thermionic fabricator and make your first tubes.%n%n§3You can also use the circuit assembler for a better output. Why did we have you make the TF again?

# Quest.582 - The Multifarm
gtnh.quest582.name=The Multifarm
gtnh.quest582.desc=The smallest farm you can build requires 36 farm blocks (3x4x3 - the largest is 5x4x5 or 100 farm blocks). Place the underlying blocks corresponding to the farm type you built. In this case, Stone Bricks. You can place these blocks beside or under the multi structure, but not the layer above. It will search 6 blocks above these for dirt/farmland/sand/soul sand/humus depending on farm type, with the appropriate crops, saplings, etc on top of that. %n%nYou can use different modes to collect different crops. Arboretum for trees, infernal for nether wart and so on. You can even mix and match modes on the same farm - cutting trees down for wood in part, and collecting fruit from trees without destroying it in another, for example. So long as they're on different sides, at least.%n%n§YYou may need to experiment a bit to see what works, but https://ftbwiki.org/MultiFarm#Managed_Farms has a decent list, though it doesn't specify cotton for managed crop farms for example. It might be a GTNH change, I dunno. A number of crops have an added IC2 crop version as well, so you may prefer those for the higher yield if you level them up. Orchard mode works with Pam's, and Witchery, just to save you some time. Pam's nether crops however don't seem to work at all though.

# Quest.583 - Farm Logic
gtnh.quest583.name=Farm Logic
gtnh.quest583.desc=This chip allows you to select the farm type (when combined with the right electron tubes), and not use the default of growing trees. Unless that's what you want, in which case you don't need it. %n%nFor each circuit tier, you can configure 1/4 more of your farm.

# Quest.584 - Changing Your Foresty Circuit Configuration
gtnh.quest584.name=Changing Your Foresty Circuit Configuration
gtnh.quest584.desc=The (forestry) soldering iron is a tool used for attaching electron tubes to circuit boards in order to manipulate how an electrical engine works or to program multifarms, as well as upgrading the squeezer or centrifuge. Honestly, you'll probably only use it for the multifarm though.%n%nOnce electron tubes have been attached to a circuit board they cannot be removed, only replaced. The circuit board is automatically crafted as soon as the basic recipe requirements are met, so it's best practice to first place your electron tubes and then add the circuit board.%n%nThe soldering iron can also be used to remove the circuit board from electrical engines, multifarms, squeezers and centrifuges by opening the machine's GUI and left clicking with the soldering iron on the circuit board slot.

# Quest.585 - Heating Coils

# Quest.589 - Multifarm: Hatch
gtnh.quest589.name=Multifarm: Hatch
gtnh.quest589.desc=You can supply and extract items from the farm by using farm hatches that are connected to pipe systems. %n%nSupplying items%nThe farm hatch is clever enough to know which item goes where. If an item isn't appropriate for the farm's configuration, the hatch will simply reject it.%n%nExtracting items%nAny item that is harvested by the Multifarm is automatically ejected by the farm hatches into inventories or pipes. Pipes can be used to extract from other sides. You may need more than one, or a better conveyor if it isn't extracting fast enough for you.

# Quest.590 - Multifarm: Valve
gtnh.quest590.name=Multifarm: Valve
gtnh.quest590.desc=Most farms require water for hydration purposes. Although you can do it manually by supplying it through liquid containers (such as cans), you can also automate the process by using farm valves.%n%nBy connecting fluid pipes into the farm valve and supplying water, you can automatically fill the farm's water tank.%n%nIf it hasn't rained for a while, the required water will go up, up to 1500%. Use an Everfull Urn, or Reservoir (RIO) for serious water needs.

# Quest.591 - Multifarm: Control
gtnh.quest591.name=Multifarm: Control
gtnh.quest591.desc=You can control which fields of your farm work by applying a redstone signal to the control block.

# Quest.592 - Multifarm: Gearbox
gtnh.quest592.name=Multifarm: Gearbox
gtnh.quest592.desc=To power your farm and have it automatically harvest crops, you will need at least one farm gearbox to supply power. You can use either RF or EU. If you use EU, make sure to use a cable to allow conversion. Farm operations can be hastened with additional gearboxes.%n%nTesting has shown that splitting the amps to 4 gearboxes (4A ULV) works better than sending 1A LV to 4 gearboxes.%n%nA max sized IC2 Crop farm (5x4x5) using all space possible with max stat seeds (31/31/0) on a fast crop needs only 6A ULV to keep up.%n%nSimilarly, a max sized small farm (3x4x3) using all space possible with max stat seeds (31/31/0) on a high tier, moderate speed crop needs only 4A ULV.%n%nSending more power to the same gearbox doesn't work. If it can get to max RF capacity but your farm can't keep up, sending more power won't help, so add more gearboxes.%n%nIn addition, you lose 2 EU from the the energy emitting device for every A of ULV (which is only 8 to begin with), so it's not nearly as efficient as using LV or higher. Just keep in mind that more A to more gearboxes is better than to the same one.%n%nOf course, if you mix your slower crops with your faster ones, you aren't likely to need to min-max to this extent.

# Quest.593 - Enhanced Farm Logic
gtnh.quest593.name=Enhanced Farm Logic

# Quest.598 - §5§lAntimony
gtnh.quest598.name=§5§lAntimony
gtnh.quest598.desc=The most efficient way to get antimony for batteries is to run stibnite through a BBF or EBF, burning off the impurities (sulfur), and giving you more antimony. You can also centrifuge it if you want to keep the sulfur. You can also centrifuge tetrahedrite dust if you're desperate.

# Quest.599 - §5§lThermal Centrifuge
gtnh.quest599.name=§5§lThermal Centrifuge
gtnh.quest599.desc=A machine to get different byproducts out of your crushed or purified ore dust. It's useful for getting a bit of Gallium out of crushed Zinc Ore for your Diodes needed in good circuits.%n%nWhen you have IC2 nuclear reactors and want to recycle your depleted fuel rods, it's the only way to do so.%n%nIf you can't produce the 2A of LV power for this machine right now, wait until you get to MV and use transformers to power an LV version.%n%nIn LV, you can obtain the same ore byproducts via different methods. The Thermal Centrifuge only becomes really important in HV when you can combine it with the HV macerator.%n%n§4Sending MV power to an LV device, even if it uses more than 1A will cause an explosion, so don't do that.

# Quest.600 - Hunger No More
gtnh.quest600.name=Hunger No More
gtnh.quest600.desc=The hunger is constantly following you, consuming you, never letting you rest. The world around you is full of nourishing fruits, vegetables and crafted meals. Use them to curb your insatiable hunger.

# Quest.601 - Building Made Easy
gtnh.quest601.name=Building Made Easy

# Quest.604 - §6§lRF Batteries
gtnh.quest604.name=§6§lRF Batteries
gtnh.quest604.desc=Basic Capacitor Banks are RF batteries which can store the RF power you generate. You can put many blocks together to enlarge your total battery capacity - they will merge into one battery.%n%nYou can also change the mode of each face using your wire cutters or yeta wrench instead of the GUI. One option is a nice display of input and output RF, but it has to be taller than it is wide.%n%nThese are great for interfacing with RF machines. GT wires will convert to RF, but they send a full amp packet no matter what. EnderIO machines properly accept it, but others like Genetics do not and waste most of the packet, so consider using them with any RF machine if it looks like you need it.

# Quest.605 - Slay the Eyes!
gtnh.quest605.name=Slay the Eyes!

# Quest.609 - §5§lBattery Alloy
gtnh.quest609.name=§5§lBattery Alloy
gtnh.quest609.desc=Mixing antimony and lead in the alloy smelter will give you battery alloy. Combine it with tin cable and voila, there's your small battery hull.%n%nSmall = LV, Medium = MV, Large = HV. It gets weirder after that.%n%n§3Note that if you make the battery alloy in the mixer you need to use dusts, but if you use the alloy smelter you can use either.

# Quest.610 - Lead, Galena, Silver and Cryolite
gtnh.quest610.name=Lead, Galena, Silver and Cryolite
gtnh.quest610.desc=You can't find Lead in the Overworld or the Nether. So it's time to explore the mysterious Twilight Forest a bit and find a Galena vein at Y 5-40.%n%nYou can get Lead, Silver, Cryolite for Aluminium production and Galena (more lead) in the vein.%n%n§3There's some Silver in small ores in the OW and Nether, but this is a better source.

# Quest.611 - §5§lSingle Use Battery: Mercury
gtnh.quest611.name=§5§lSingle Use Battery: Mercury
gtnh.quest611.desc=Mercury and acid batteries are single-use batteries. They are crafted fully charged but cannot be re-charged. Once their stored energy is depleted, they can be placed in an extractor to be converted back into small battery hulls.

gtnh.quest612.name=§5§lSingle Use Battery: Acid
gtnh.quest612.desc=Mercury and acid Batteries are single-use batteries. They are crafted fully charged but cannot be re-charged. Once their stored energy is depleted, they can be placed in an extractor to be converted back into small battery hulls.

# Quest.613 - §5§lReusable Battery: Sodium
gtnh.quest613.name=§5§lReusable Battery: Sodium
gtnh.quest613.desc=Sodium, cadmium, and lithium batteries are rechargeable batteries. They're crafted without stored energy, but can be charged in any gregtech machine. If unneeded, they can be placed in an extractor and converted back into small battery hulls, but their contents are lost.%n%nIf placed in a machine, it will fill up if there's excess power, and drain if the machine can't get enough. Handy for high-EU machines you don't want to choke.%n%n§3Sodium is the one that stores the least EU of the 3 rechargable batteries, but is definitely the easiest to get.

# Quest.614 - §5§lReusable Battery: Cadmium
gtnh.quest614.name=§5§lReusable Battery: Cadmium
gtnh.quest614.desc=This is the Cadmium one.

# Quest.615 - §5§lReusable Battery: Lithium

# Quest.617 - §5§lFluid Canner
gtnh.quest617.name=§5§lFluid Canner
gtnh.quest617.desc=The fluid canner can be used to fill cells, batteries (acid only), coolant cells, etc with a fluid. Most of the time, you won't need it, since you can fill cells with a GT tank, and single use batteries suck. There are some fluids that won't work properly like molten redstone, so that's why this device even exists.%n%nAnother interesting thing about the fluid canner is that it can be transformed into a raintank, by attaching a drain cover on its top (Any machine with a tank actually can be...).

# Quest.618 - §5§lSulfuric Acid
gtnh.quest618.name=§5§lSulfuric Acid
gtnh.quest618.desc=Combining sulfur trioxide and water in the chemical reactor will give you sulfuric acid for your single use acid batteries. You'll need to make sulfur dioxide first.%n%nOn the other hand if you've made some light fuel you'll have some spare hydrogen sulfide you can also turn into sulfuric acid (after a couple steps), and if you've automated it, you'll be drowning in it honestly. Once you can make an LCR, you can skip directly from HS to SA in one step. Keep in mind that you'll need all that acid for making stuff instead of for single use batteries by then.

# Quest.619 - §5§lBattery Buffer
gtnh.quest619.name=§5§lBattery Buffer
gtnh.quest619.desc=Batteries work pretty much the same in a battery buffer as in a regular machine's battery slot. Battery buffers are used to buffer power to stabilize output.%n%nThey come in different sizes: 1, 4, 9(!) and 16 slots. They can draw 2A and output 1A per battery inserted - watch your wire amperage! Cables come in 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 12x, and 16x, with tin transferring 1A per size. Make sure not to mess up, or your cable will melt, becoming a fire, and possibly an explosion.%n%nRemember that there's loss when outputting EU from any GT machine, so putting 4 4-slot ones in a row loses 8 power compared to 2 from 1 16-slot one. And this is for every amp too.%n%n§3You can import batteries into one, but ONLY empty acid batteries can be exported from one. No, you can't get around this.

# Quest.620 - §5§lIC2 Battery

gtnh.quest662.name=§5§lBasic Arc Furnace
gtnh.quest662.desc=The arc furnace is an alternative to macerating stuff back into dusts and for making wrought iron, annealed copper, and glass (in MV). You get ingots, and sometimes different materials back from recycling than with a macerator. You also have all 4 slots at LV. The recipes use oxygen and 3A of power.%n%n§3Just ignore the plasma one.%n%n§3And no, you can't just send 1A of MV, that'll just cause an explosion.

# Quest.663 - §5§lFaster Steel Production
gtnh.quest663.name=§5§lFaster Steel Production
gtnh.quest663.desc=A faster alternative to steel production is to use the arc furnace and smelt iron ingots (or dust) into wrought iron ingots. Then macerate them to dust and smelt them very fast in the EBF to steel.%n%nOf course, you'll need enough oxygen to do so.

# Quest.667 - Trainspotting
gtnh.quest667.name=Trainspotting
gtnh.quest667.desc=The wooden tracks can be made without any machine. Functionally equivalent to normal rails, but with a lower maximum speed (for safety reasons).%n%nHint: You can use your wooden rails for Steve's carts farms.

# Quest.668 - Rubber Boat
gtnh.quest668.name=Rubber Boat
gtnh.quest668.desc=The rubber dinghy requires only a few rubber plates.

# Quest.671 - Electric Boat
gtnh.quest671.name=Electric Boat
gtnh.quest671.desc=The electric boat works mostly like a vanilla boat, chugging through the water at a decent pace. It will hopefully drop itself once you crash, which is slightly nicer than the usual sticks. That's all well and good, but what if we utilize the electric engine? Wearing an energy storage device in your chestplate slot, like a batpack or energypack, will cause the boat to drain energy from it and propel you forward at supersonic speed! Doing this will consume about 100 EU per block traveled, so even a decent batpack won't last long!

# Quest.672 - Boat Shape?
gtnh.quest672.name=Boat Shape?
gtnh.quest672.desc=Really? Yes for the more advanced boats you need a new shape form.%n%nYou need to make an Extruder first to progress further.

# Quest.673 - §5§lLV Extruder

gtnh.quest675.desc=The switch lever is the manual version of the switch motor, requiring a player to operate it instead of a redstone signal.%n%nIt is used in various signaling systems, mainly to change the way switch tracks and wye tracks work.

# Quest.676 - Crowbar
gtnh.quest676.name=Crowbar
gtnh.quest676.desc=The crowbar comes in a Railcraft (and thaumcraft versions of RC) and a gregtech variant. It is used to manipulate machines from railcraft, remove plates and any other covers (pumps, conveyor modules, etc.) from gregtech pipes and machines as well as breaking certain objects faster, such as tracks. This tool is also used to access certain inventories from Railcraft.%n%nHold a crowbar and shift + right click to attach carts. Click the starting cart then continue to click to add more carts to the link. Carts will act slower the more connections are made.%n%nThe crowbar can be used as a weapon, though it costs twice as much durability on attack (just like any other non weapon tool...).

# Quest.677 - Minecart
gtnh.quest677.name=Minecart
gtnh.quest677.desc=After you craft your first cart the journey can begin...%n%nWell, not really.

# Quest.693 - §2§lFallen From the Sky
gtnh.quest693.name=§2§lFallen From the Sky
gtnh.quest693.desc=You may have noticed big meteors everywhere, and maybe wondered if they're useful somehow? Well, they are, but not just yet. I'll give you a reward for collecting some now.%n%nInside the meteor you can find a skystone chest containing some processor press plates. Save them for later, you can't do AE2 without them. Though you can also just make them yourself in EV. Plus the chest is nice, and can be placed underneath blocks and still opened.%n%nHint: If all your surface meteors have been raided, put some skystone in your Ore Finder to find underground ones. Or wait until you can make the compass to find them.

# Quest.694 - §3§lOne Anvil... Better Make That Two!

Make sure to connect the pipe to the faucet using a wrench. Now the molten fluid will flow inside the pipe. Under or next to the pipe you have to place the casting basins or tables.%n%nA hopper and a chest underneath will auto-output products from the casting blocks. %n%nNOTE: Faucets will output precisely 144L each activation if you toggle it off immediately. That's going to have some uses later on...

# Quest.696 - §6§lAutomation, Tier 2
gtnh.quest696.name=§6§lAutomation, Tier 2
gtnh.quest696.desc=You want a better automation than using pipes? Sure, craft a comparator and link it with redstone dust placed on the ground. The redstone needs to be adjacent to the faucet to activate the crafting process.

# Quest.697 - §6§l2x Steel
gtnh.quest697.name=§6§l2x Steel
gtnh.quest697.desc=Steel production is so slow. If you got enough bricks and clay, build a second BBF. Build it attached to the first one, so they can share a wall and you will save some bricks, clay and concrete.%n%n§4Note that this will generate twice as much pollution in total - consider moving them further away.

gtnh.quest699.name=§6§lWhy One Coke Oven When You Can Have Ten?
gtnh.quest699.desc=Your bricked blast furnace uses coal like hell and your steam boilers do too? Well it's time to make more coke ovens and automate them a bit. Wooden fluid pipes and tin item pipes will help you reach your goal. You can use either faucets with redstone clocks or LV pumps to empty the creosote. For the charcoal, hoppers are easy to get once you have an assembler.%n%nUnlike GregTech multiblocks, coke ovens must have 1 space separating each oven.%n%nSearch NEI for a more efficient way to make coke oven bricks.%n%n§4You need to use a steel wrench on tin item pipes.

# Quest.718 - Moron's Manual to Fecund Farms
gtnh.quest718.name=Moron's Manual to Fecund Farms
gtnh.quest718.desc=If you ever wanted to know how crop breeding works you are in the right place. Get some crops (the sticks) and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. %n%nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdWdFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd %nFFFdddFFF%nNow place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.%n%nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.%n%nWith some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.%n%nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.%n%nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds. %n%nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.%n%nNote that the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.%n%nDon't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. %n%nCrossing happens when 2 or more almost mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation. More details in the IC2 cropnalyzer quest.

# Quest.719 - First Breeding
gtnh.quest719.name=First Breeding
gtnh.quest719.desc=New plants have grown on your crop sticks. You can harvest the crop by right clicking it.%n%nLeft clicking will destroy the plant and drop a seedbag. This is not guaranteed however, but the chances rise as the maturity does. Collect 8 seeds of any kind to complete this quest.%n%nTo unlock the next quest, you will need the LV scanner.%n%nIf you haven't already, consider building some Filing Cabinets. They make storing and moving large quantities of seeds a breeze. Plus they will properly sort the seeds based on name. To find a specific seed, type its name in the NEI search bar, and double click the bar so it highlights yellow.  Now you can look through the Filing Cabinet and find the exact seedbag you want.%n%nOr use double chests and toss the ones you don't want.

# Quest.720 - Weeds II

# Quest.721 - Unknown Seeds No More
gtnh.quest721.name=Unknown Seeds No More
gtnh.quest721.desc=You have a lot of unknown seeds already. Use your scanner to scan all the seeds.%n %nSeeds can be planted again to breed better and more resilient crops.%n%nLater you can use your portable scanner to see the crop stats while still in the ground.%n%nGrowability depends on having dirt beneath your crop (4 max), biome (swamp/jungle types are all pretty much the same), air quality (increases up to Y124 and don't place a lot above/around your plants), hydration, and fertilizer.  When the crop tier and plant stats get high enough, they will actually die without enough Growability. This is never a concern if you use a good biome though.%n%nAs long as you water and fertilize them, you can pretty much grow crops anywhere.%n%nIf the Growth stat gets too high, greather than 24 or so, the plant will spread weeds onto neighbors.%n%nSome crops, such as Redwheat or oreberries, require certain light levels to crossbreed or grow.

# Quest.722 - Speed Up Your Plant Growth
gtnh.quest722.name=Speed Up Your Plant Growth
gtnh.quest722.desc=To speed up the growth process a bit you can use a fertilizer. You will note, however, that bone meal no longer works. A bit of ash, apatite or calcite mixed with some water in a chemical reactor will give you the fertilizer you need. Apply by hand.

# Quest.723 - Potatos, Carrots, Pumpkins and Melons
gtnh.quest723.name=Potatos, Carrots, Pumpkins and Melons
gtnh.quest723.desc=Your seeds have three different values: Growth, gain, and resistance (GGR).%n%nThe only way to change a crop's GGR without 3rd party tools (like NBTedit!) is through cross breeding. When two plants cross-breed, the resulting plant will have a GGR score that is between both "parent" plants' GGR. Sometimes it will also be a little bit higher or lower. Thus, to obtain high GGR scores you must go through numerous generations of crossbreeding.%n%nThe highest score for GGR is 31, while the lowest is 0.%n%n§3BTW, if you want to skip all this BS, the nbtedit command is /nbtedit me, click root in the upper left, then scroll down to inventory, and find the seedbag (empty your inventory first to make it easier) and click on the icons until you find the page with the stats. Once you've found the GGR stats, select one and click edit in the upper left, make sure to save.%n%n§4Remember that you can §5permanantly brick your character!§4 So make a backup first if you don't know what you're doing, or want to edit your actual character.§r%n%nOf course, you can't do any of this on a server.

# Quest.724 - Weeds
gtnh.quest724.name=Weeds
gtnh.quest724.desc=Weeds will show up from time to time on empty or double crop sticks. They will spread from there an take over all your precious crops, so harvest the weed with your weed trowel before you start desiring to reload the last backup. Later you can make some Weed-EX to prevent them from appearing (until it runs out).

# Quest.725 - Flower Power
gtnh.quest725.name=Flower Power
gtnh.quest725.desc=Growing dyes on crops sticks? Try to plant some flowers. If you cross breed Rose and Dandelion flowers maybe you'll get a new flower and new dyes with different colors.%n%nYou will need to plant 4 vanilla flowers to get them on a cropstick. They also don't plant unless they are in bright light.%n%nTo get "Rose Seeds" place poppies. Honestly there's several flowers you can use, though.%n%n§3If you actually want these for dyes, go make the rainbow cactus instead.

# Quest.726 - §5§lChemical Rubber Production
gtnh.quest726.name=§5§lChemical Rubber Production
gtnh.quest726.desc=A much more efficient way to make insulated cables is by making molten rubber in a chemical reactor, which can be applied to a cable in the assembling machine. When you put both machines next to each other you can output the molten rubber directly to the assembling machine by clicking the fluid auto-output button on the chemical reactor. Make sure to set the correct side of the reactor as output side by wrenching it. Also remember to use the right circuit in the assembling machine.

# Quest.727 - §1§2§lBetter Than Barrels
gtnh.quest727.name=§1§2§lBetter Than Barrels
gtnh.quest727.desc=While barrels offer a slot for a single item, drawers can have up to 4 slots each (holding 16 stacks per slot).%n%nJust watch out, they do come with some downsides. You won't be able to make them point up or down, and you can only access the contents from the front (automation can use any side). 

# Quest.728 - §2§lCompact Drawers
gtnh.quest728.name=§2§lCompact Drawers
gtnh.quest728.desc=They are very compact and add some fanciness to your glorious dirt base. 

# Quest.729 - §2§lFraming Drawers
gtnh.quest729.name=§2§lFraming Drawers
gtnh.quest729.desc=Now you can really make some swaggy and even FANCIER drawers using this table, all you have to do is place some decorative blocks (works with almost ALL decorative blocks) and it will take their texture, the TOP left is the outer Square bottom left is for the front face and top right is for the borders.

# Quest.730 - §6§lBio Fuels
gtnh.quest730.name=§6§lBio Fuels
gtnh.quest730.desc=You've been using steam, creosote, and possibly oil plus their byproducts to generate power. It's time to start making bio diesel. The first step is to make plant balls out of organic materials. You can use wheat, sugarcane, apples, saplings or, well, practially anything. Indigo blossoms are 4:1 and unlike the rest of the IC2 crops with the same ratio, not really useful for anything else. Realistically, you'll probably just use saplings though, since you'll want/need a tree farm anyway.%n%nBe sure you have a Forestry multifarm, Steve's Carts Farm, IC2 Crop Sticks with a harvester, or whatever, because you need plenty of biomaterials for constant bio diesel production.

# Quest.731 - §6§lPlantballs
gtnh.quest731.name=§6§lPlantballs
gtnh.quest731.desc=Next you should compress plantballs out of your wheat.%n%nThe MV compressor is twice as fast as the LV. You might think this means using it is a good idea. You would be §4WRONG§r. Why? Remember it also uses 4x the power. This means you spend 4x the EU to get the same amount of EU, twice as fast. Eventually, you end up with an EU deficit with this kind of setup, though not necessarily this setup. Ironic, I know. You can use multiple machines (like, a lot), and later use a Processing Array or multiblock if there is one. This applies to all fuel production, basically.

# Quest.732 - §6§lPlant Mass
gtnh.quest732.name=§6§lPlant Mass
gtnh.quest732.desc=Macerate the plantballs down to plant mass for better processing. The HV macerator has an extra slot so you can get more, but it's not worth it power-wise, same for EV and IV.

# Quest.733 - §6§lBio Chaff
gtnh.quest733.name=§6§lBio Chaff
gtnh.quest733.desc=Plant mass needs to be centrifuged into bio chaff, the base material to make biomass.

# Quest.737 - Can u eat those?
gtnh.quest737.name=Can u eat those?
gtnh.quest737.desc=No you can't eat them but you can add them to your routed pipes. Without chips routed pipes can't do anything on their own, chips also have a GUI to configure them which can be opened by right clicking. %nThere are 8 types of chips:%n%n-Item extractor chip can be used to send items from its inventory to responder, dynamic responder, terminator and overflow responder chips in a pipe network. %n%n-Item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network which match the filter configured to the inventory connected to the responder chip. Chips with higher priority value will receive items first until the inventory is full then will be sent to other inventories with valid filters and remaining space.%n%n-Dynamic item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network that match items inside the dynamic item responder connected inventory. This chip has to be in the same interface pipe as the item responder chip in order to work. Priority rules apply here as well. %n%n-Item overflow responder works exactly the same as the item responder chip, however it only accepts items that cannot go to an item responder chip, dynamic item responder chip, or item terminator chip. %n%n-Item terminator chip works as a backup for responder chips.%n%n-Item broadcaster chip will show you the inventory connected to the routed request pipe on the pipe network and can be used to retrieve items from it. They can also extract from the side you configure. %n%n-Item stock keeper chip will constantly check the network for items and pull them to its pipe. If the chip is set to pull when empty, it will only pull if the inventory next to it is empty, otherwise it will pull when there are less items in the inventory than configured in the chip.%n%n-Item crafting chips craft things. %n%n-Item crafting extension chips are placed inside the item crafting chips. Make sure you randomize the id.

# Quest.738 - Routed Pipes
gtnh.quest738.name=Routed Pipes
gtnh.quest738.desc=There are six types of routed pipes: %n%n-Junction pipe is used to form an intersection that will allow other routed pipes to communicate. %n%n-Interface pipe will connect to an inventory allowing you to extract or insert items, chips can be used to control the logic. %n%n-Request pipe will allow requesting only specific items to be send through pipes.%n%n-Firewall pipe can control which items can pass through them.

# Quest.739 - Ghetto ME System
gtnh.quest739.name=Ghetto ME System
gtnh.quest739.desc=§4Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will kill TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.§r%n%nNow that you are familiar with the mod it's time to organize items in your base a bit. These are the things you need in order to get a basic extract/insert system.%n%nFirst of all you will need a drawer controller. You can pick it from here or craft it yourself and place it down. Next to it add as much drawers as you want, and make sure they are touching each other or the controller.%n%nThe next step is to connect a routed interface pipe to your drawer controller. Take the item responder chip and configure it to filter mode: blacklist (this will allow you to get any items from your system) and add the chip to the routed interface pipe by right clicking on it. Don't forget the dynamic item responder.%n%nIn order to allow your system to be able to see items you need to add the item broadcast chip TO THE SAME ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE DRAWER CONTROLLER.%n%nThe last step is to connect a routed request pipe IN THE SAME NETWORK AS THE ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE and right click it to access the GUI. You can only extract items from it. In order to insert items simply right click them on the drawer controller. %n%nYou can find more complex tutorials on youtube for autocrafting.

# Quest.740 - §6§lExtrude All the Things
gtnh.quest740.name=§6§lExtrude All the Things
gtnh.quest740.desc=Now that you've hit MV tier, it's time to get a better ratio when making rods, pipes, wires, plates and many more parts. Most extruder recipes use more than 32 EU/t so you need an MV extruder. After crafting the machine you need extruder shapes for the different types of parts you want to make.%n%nNote that not all of these are necessarily useful, like the ingot one for example.%n%n§3Most of the Tinkers Gregworks tool parts are made in the extruder. They also have long extrusion times to balance out their usefulness.

gtnh.quest742.desc=By making a hammer you are now able to mine a shaft of 3x3 blocks. You can use iron, steel, or alumite poured from the Smeltery, it doesn't need to be steel. Higher tier metals require the MV extruder. You'll need a hammer head, two large plates and a large rod for your hammer.  Be careful in the Nether or you could be boiled in lava very quickly.%n%n§6The quest should accept the tool whatever materials you used.

# Quest.743 - §3§lCutting a Tree log by log is so Old School
gtnh.quest743.name=§3§lCutting a Tree log by log is so Old School
gtnh.quest743.desc=By making a lumber axe you are now able to cut down the entire tree in one hit. You can use iron, steel, or alumite poured from the Smeltery, it doesn't need to be steel. Higher tier metals require the MV extruder. Don't forget your backpack when you are cutting a sacred oak tree down.%n%n§6The quest should accept the tool whatever materials you used.%n%n§3Protip: Make one out of netherrack, the lower the mining speed, the less XP needed to level up. Use the modifier slots to add reinforced. Once you've got it leveled up enough, change the parts out for better (and faster) ones. You can't use auto-smelt, so don't bother with that.

# Quest.744 - §3§lMining Dirt Block by Block is so Old School
gtnh.quest744.name=§3§lMining Dirt Block by Block is so Old School
gtnh.quest744.desc=By making an excavator you are now able to mine dirt in a 3x3 area. You can use iron, steel, or alumite poured from the Smeltery, it doesn't need to be steel. %n%nHigher tier metals require the MV extruder. Don't destroy your whole garden.%n%n§6The quest should accept the tool whatever materials you used.

# Quest.745 - §5§lGlue
gtnh.quest745.name=§5§lGlue
gtnh.quest745.desc=If you centrifuge sticky resin, you get glue. Glue is very useful in the creation of good circuit boards.%n%n§3Note that this is GT glue, not TiC glue.

# Quest.746 - §6§lSolar Grade Ingots
gtnh.quest746.name=§6§lSolar Grade Ingots

# Quest.747 - §5§lDiodes
gtnh.quest747.name=§5§lDiodes
gtnh.quest747.desc=Good circuits need diodes. There are two main ways to craft them. You can crush your the Gallium Arsenide crystals to dust and combine that with fine copper wires and molten glass. Once you have solar grade silicon you can use it to make silicon wafers in your EBF to make even more. Note that the wafers are much more efficient on gallium and arsenic, so even a reduced amount is still worth it.%n%nMake sure you check all the NEI recipes for advanced items instead of just using the first one you find. You can use annealed copper wires and polyethylene to increase your output even more. %n

# Quest.748 - §5§lEmpty Circuit Board
gtnh.quest748.name=§5§lEmpty Circuit Board
gtnh.quest748.desc=Good circuit boards require wooden pulp and refined glue to make phenolic circuit boards. By adding gold wire you can craft a good circuit board.%n%n§3There's more efficient ways to make it if you look in NEI.

# Quest.749 - §6§lAre You Prepared For HV?
gtnh.quest749.name=§6§lAre You Prepared For HV?
gtnh.quest749.desc=Stainless steel will be the tier material for HV. Use a MV mixer to produce the dust.%n%nManganese can be acquired as ore byproducts from spessartine, pyrolusite and tantalite ore. You can also pull them apart to get even more. Alternatively you can take apart Red Garnet dusts. If you get desperate, you can buy some ore from the Coins tab.%n%nChrome can be centrifuged out of ruby dust. You can get ruby dust from redstone if the ruby in redstone veins isn't enough.

gtnh.quest753.name=§6§lStainless Steel EBF processing
gtnh.quest753.desc=Stainless Steel ingots are made in the Electric Blast Furnace at a temperature of 1700K.%n%nIt takes 85 seconds at 480 EU/t or 60 seconds at 480 EU/t by adding Oxygen gas. Always add a gas if you can, you're saving tons of power by doing so, and you're gonna need a TON of SS. The Cracker, Large Steam Turbine, and Distillery Tower all need huge amounts of SS. A single DT uses several stacks, and you're gonna want more than just one.

# Quest.754 - §6§lMV Energy Hatch
gtnh.quest754.name=§6§lMV Energy Hatch
gtnh.quest754.desc=Some materials like stainless steel require 480 EU/t. Your LV hatches are not good enough. Craft a minimum of two MV hatches to upgrade your electric blast furnace to HV.%n%n§3BTW, if a MB recipe is 1EU over 1A for that tier, you §omust§r §3use a second energy hatch for it to use 2A or more.

# Quest.755 - §6§lBetter Than Duct Tape
gtnh.quest755.name=§6§lBetter Than Duct Tape
gtnh.quest755.desc=Using a soldering iron tool to remove the "burned out circuits" message is cheaper than duct tape. %n%nThe soldering iron requires one soldering material item and 10,000 EU. Valid soldering materials are fine wires, rods, and ingots made from either tin, lead, or soldering alloy. The soldering iron will consume the first such material it finds in the player's inventory. Since you'll likely have more than enough, Fine Wires of Soldering Alloy are probably best.%n%nYou can also use it to adjust the redstone strength from weak to strong emitted by GT machines.%n%nAlso, while holding it all pipes, wires, and cables will look very small, so that you can see everything past them, and also be sure of the exact connections.%n%nIn order to "complete" the quest you'll need to charge the soldering iron after you craft it.%n%nFor the other problems other tools are necessary.%n%nPossible problems                Tool to fix%n"Pipe is loose."

# Quest.759 - §6§lMolten Polyethylene
gtnh.quest759.name=§6§lMolten Polyethylene
gtnh.quest759.desc=Polyethylene is made out of ethylene and oxygen in a chemical reactor. Molten Polyethylene cells hold 144L, perfect for 1 ingot or plate. %nIf you want precise amounts, you can use a Volumetric Flask once you electrolyze some Boron from Borax.%n%nYou §omay§r have started getting damaged from holding the cells. If you have, put your glove baubles back on. All Molten cells cause damage and store 144L. Mostly, Molten cells come from metal-type materials, or stuff that was melted. Excuse me, §oFluid Extracted§r, whatever that's supposed to mean.%n%nNotice some leftovers? Try using the plunger, or if you have the materials, you can use 12 ethylene cells and 84 oxygen cells to make exactly 125 cells of polyethylene.

# Quest.760 - §6§lClay Electrolyzing
gtnh.quest760.name=§6§lClay Electrolyzing
gtnh.quest760.desc=If you looked through NEI you may have found out that electrolyzing clay dust will give you Alumina, Silicon Dioxide, Sodium, and Lithium dust. And water, but you're probably just voiding that already, right? There's plenty of stained clay blocks found in canyon, mesa, lush desert biomes or several to a couple dozen on mountains that can be pulverized to clay dust.%n%nThere's more ways to get alumina now that you're in MV, enough that it's basically worthless by the time you get to EV.

# Quest.761 - §6§lPowderbarrels
gtnh.quest761.name=§6§lPowderbarrels
gtnh.quest761.desc=Powderbarrels are twice as good as dynamite in the implosion compressor. Craft one stack.

# Quest.762 - §6§lTNT
gtnh.quest762.name=§6§lTNT
gtnh.quest762.desc=TNT is much more powerful than the powderbarrel but much harder to craft. There are LV and HV ways to craft. At LV you need heavy or light fuel to make some toluene which can be solidified to gelled toluene. Alternatively you can use sugar and plastic dust in a chemical reactor to make toluene more efficiently. Mix it with sulfuric acid to make TNT.%n%nThe HV petrol way requires an oil cracking unit to make all kinds of cracked fuel or cracked naphta and a distillation tower to extract toluene from that.%nThough you can also go the wood tar route in mid-MV.

# Quest.763 - §6§liTNT
gtnh.quest763.name=§6§liTNT
gtnh.quest763.desc=Industrial TNT is the HV variant of TNT. It explodes with more power, and you can't pick it up. Not by hand anyway

# Quest.765 - §6§lTime to Drill for Oil!
gtnh.quest765.name=§6§lTime to Drill for Oil!
gtnh.quest765.desc=Pumps are nice but you're going to reach a point where you'll want MOOOOOOOOOOOOORE oil. This multiblock will help with that but you'll need to search for oil using a seismic prospector. You can find raw, light, medium, and heavy oil. There's also a chance to find natural gas.%n%nHigher tiers of power will drill faster. You need to upgrade the energy hatch corresponding to the power tier. %n%nLater you can upgrade the oil drilling rig so it extracts from more than one chunk at a time.%n%nYou need mining pipes in the controller. If you need more than 64, you can use an input bus.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on any side. And set a waypoint with JourneyMaps so you don't forget where you placed it!%n%nSpace dims can also have fluids beneath bedrock. For info, check the Tips and Tricks tab.

# Quest.766 - §6§lLet's Get Crackin!
gtnh.quest766.name=§6§lLet's Get Crackin!
gtnh.quest766.desc=Cracking oil products like light and heavy fuel with the oil cracker is faster and more efficent than using a chemical reactor, producing 25 to 50 percent more output, depending on which cracking method it's doing (steam does 50%, hydro does 25% but consumes 20% less hydrogen). Cracked products will result in additional by-products in the distillation tower. It is a smart idea to get this multiblock since you are going to need TONS of industrial TNT from Toluene for advanced tier rockets. %n%nThe 16 coils form 2 vertical rings of 8 on either side of the controller. The casings between the rings can be replaced with a hatch for steam/hydrogen input. Energy hatch and maintenance hatch can replace any of the casings. The input product hatch and output product hatch must replace one of the casings outside of the coils.%n%nHint: Only GT/Railcraft steam can be used, not ic2 steam. You can use a fluid heater to make it instead of a boiler.%n%n§3The circuit goes in the controller.%n%n§3PS: I listed all the cracker recipes on the spreadsheet for you to look at in a convenient format. Now you can easily compare which oil path to take!

gtnh.quest767.name=§5§lAnalyzing the Soil
gtnh.quest767.desc=Tired of looking for ores by hand? Want to find underground oil that will last a long time? A seismic prospector will tell you the ores in the surrounding chunks in a (sorta) handy book you can read, and also the underground fluids beneath you. §3PS, it doesn't need to be powered.§r%n%nTo determine which kind of fluid (4 types of oil, or natural gas for the OW. See the quest in tips and tricks once you've made an oil drill) there is in the chunk you need to scan the soil by right clicking an Advanced §3(This one doesn't explode the user too on use. Features!)§r Seismic Prospector with 2 Powderbarrels, 4 Glyceryl Trinitate cells, 8 iTNT or 16 TNT. §3(I have no idea why the more expensive ones take more either. Just accept this small kindness.)§r  Make sure you wait a few seconds after placing the prospector before applying the explosives. Otherwise, §4Boom!§r%n%n1) Right click explosives.%n2) Use a Data Stick to extract the data by right clicking on it after the animation has finished.%n3) Next you need to put the data stick in a GT scanner to have it analyzed.%n4) Place the analyzed data stick in the bottom right slot of a printer and add 3 paper in the top left slot and make sure you have at least 144L squid ink in it.%n5) Take the printed pages and combine it with a piece of leather in an assembling machine filled with at least 20 mb of refined glue.%n%nTADA! Now you have a book with detailed info about the chunks you scanned.%n%nOre locations are given as the center of the chunk. Ores that are marginal in that chunk may not be found in the center but on an edge. Look at where ores are located and determine the center of the vein. At higher tiers, it scans more chunks for ores. If you just want to know about fluids, use the lower tier version so the book isn't as long.%n%nEach underground fluid field is 8x8 chunks. This starts at 0,0 and continues for 8 chunks east and south, containing 64 chunks. Not all fields have anything in them though. Within the field the amount can vary +/- 25 percent. The amount reported in the book is the minimum and maximum per field across all chunks in the field. The prospector reports on 3x3 fields (as in, 9 fields of 8x8 chunks) at all tiers with the center field where the seismic prospector is located. Fluid extraction rate depends on many factors, check the wiki for details. In general, anything above 300 is really good. The total amount in the chunk is complicated. %n%n

gtnh.quest781.desc=This oven is the best way to get charcoal and creosote (x50 faster than Railcraft's coke oven) and other byproducts. You will need tons of bronze, iron and steel to build it, but it's worth it. Finally, it will be possible to dismantle the charcoal pit.%n%nWith Cupronickel coils the oven is a bit slower. Each coil tier speeds up the charcoal production.

# Quest.782 - §6§lMonocrystalline Silicon Boules
gtnh.quest782.name=§6§lMonocrystalline Silicon Boules
gtnh.quest782.desc=To make wafers, you need to make monocrystalline silicon boules first. The process takes 450 seconds and requires solar grade silicon dust and a small gallium arsenide crystal in the electric blast furnace. You can make 16 wafers out of every boule.

# Quest.783 - §6§lWe Need Big Toys
gtnh.quest783.name=§6§lWe Need Big Toys
gtnh.quest783.desc=All your little turbines take up too much space? Are you running out of water? It's time to solve these problems. This Large Steam Turbine can help you produce a tremendous amount of energy. It will also distill water for you, so you can use the same water again inside your Large Boiler. Don't forget to make a rotor for the turbine and put inside the controller, otherwise this multiblock won't do anything.%n%nEach turbine has a specific optimal flow, the Steam flow that gives the highest fuel efficiency, the value shown on the turbine's tooltip. This is the flow you want to match, and you can use a Fluid Regulator as a cover to make it exactly what you want, but you can go beyond this flow to get an even higher EU/t value, at a loss of fuel efficiency. You can make turbines in 4 different sizes, with larger turbines producing more EU/t, but with variying amounts of fuel efficiency. Generally, Large is the best due to having the highest fuel efficiency and a good optimal flow rate%n%nWhen using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Steam Turbines being the worst at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 150% of optimal flow to produce 112% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 200% of optimal flow to produce 133% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 250% of optimal flow to produce 156% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away. Don't exceed your dynamo hatch's maximum EU/t output, though, or you will have problems!%n%nTurbines with a small turbine durability below 75k have their recipes removed. Use NEI with the appropriate long rod to find assembler recipes that will work for you. Or the spreadsheet. Long magnalium for small turbines, long titanium for normal turbines, etc.%n%nPre-moon, the best rotors are Shadow Metal or Vibrant Alloy.%n%nPost-moon, the best HV rotors are Shadow Metal or Oriharukon (this is IV-tier). Luckily, turbines are now fully functional with multi-amp dynamos, so give those a try if you need extra amps!%n%nFor additional choices, see the spreadsheet and Large Turbine Calculator.

# Quest.784 - §6§lIt's Time to Get More Steam
gtnh.quest784.name=§6§lIt's Time to Get More Steam
gtnh.quest784.desc=As soon as you have the ability to store energy in large quantities, it would be necessary to have a way to generate energy in large quantities. You need a large bronze boiler. But in order to make this boiler, you will need a mountain of bronze. This boiler produces 800L of steam per tick. This is enough to run 10 basic steam turbines.%n%nThe large boiler can use either water or distilled water. Water is consumed at a rate of 1L of water per 150L of steam.%n%nTo make a large boiler you must make a 3x3x5 structure with Bronze Pipe Casings in the center of the middle 3 levels. The lowest level must contain at least 1 or 2 input hatches, 1 or 2 input buses, 3 or 4 fireboxes, 1 muffler, and one maintenance hatch. The lowest level can not contain any plated bricks. All hatches, buses, and mufflers must have their back side touching a firebox. The output hatch can be placed on any of the upper 4 levels.%n%n§c§cWarning: Different from other boilers, Large Boilers must contain water at all times while active. If at any point the Boiler runs out of water while it is active, it will explode.

# Quest.785 - §6§lTransistor
gtnh.quest785.name=§6§lTransistor
gtnh.quest785.desc=For the next tier we need advanced circuits. To make advanced circuits, you need transistors.

# Quest.786 - §6§lSteam is Never Enough
gtnh.quest786.name=§6§lSteam is Never Enough
gtnh.quest786.desc=Now you can make Advanced Circuits, which means it's time to build a Large Steel Boiler. Each one of these produces 1000 EU/t in Steam, which means you will need several Steam Turbines to convert it all to power! Keep in mind that the MV ones are less efficient, so calculate your losses when building your setup.

# Quest.787 - §6§lMoooooore Steam
gtnh.quest787.name=§6§lMoooooore Steam
gtnh.quest787.desc=The Titanium Large Boiler is a distant cousin to the Bronze and Steel Boilers, and it has a significant difference. Instead of accepting just about any burnable fuel, it will only accept specific ones and reject all others. You can see which ones are accepted by looking at the appropriate NEI tab, but the Solid Super Fuels are guaranteed to work.%n%nThis is a big downside, but the upside is that these boilers output respectable power even in these tiers. Without any other inputs, this boiler produces Superheated Steam at a flow rate matching 4000 EU/t, on turbines running at 100% fuel efficiency. If this becomes 150%, then the steam output will produce 6000 EU/t, almost the same as a boosted Large Combustion Engine!%n%nTo get all the power from this, though, you will need a HP Steam Turbine, followed by a regular Steam Turbine, or more than one of each if the flow rate is too big for the turbine material you've chosen. Make sure to send the Distilled Water back to the boilers!

# Quest.788 - §6§lEven More Steam? Are You Sure?
gtnh.quest788.name=§6§lEven More Steam? Are You Sure?
gtnh.quest788.desc=The Large Tungstensteel Boiler is the biggest and baddest of the four. Like the Titanium one, it is a specialized boiler that only accepts specific fuels, mainly the Solid Super Fuels, but it will produce Superheated Steam at a rate equivalent to 16000 EU/t, at 100% fuel efficiency. If you have good Steam Turbines, especially Oriharukon ones, you will get much more power than that, around 24000 EU/t or more.%n%nDepending on how many of these you build, you might need a huge amount of turbines. To solve that problem, consider going a bit above the optimal flow on each turbine, or even switching to Loose mode, although this is only a good choice if you can match the optimal flow in that mode.

You won't find much on the Overworld because of obvious reasons. To get additional zinc crushed ore drops, use a Tinker's Construct tool with the Luck (Fortune) enchant on it, probably the best use for all that lapis you got while looking for calcite. Or use a miner, if you don't mind how slow it is.%n%n- Sphalerite can be electrolyzed for a small chance of a gallium dust. Better put in a lot or you might get unlucky.%n- Zinc crushed ore can be washed and then thermal centrifuged or forge hammered and then centrifuged. But you don't always get the crushed ore as a drop, the impure dust doesn't give gallium.%n%nYou can get arsenic from realgar small ores in the Nether at Y 15-85. Centrifuge the dusts in a centrifuge.%n%nOther sources are Tinker's Construct cobalt ore in the nether and cobaltite ore in the Twilight Forest. You can use your EBF for that. You also need to level up your pickaxe to ardite or make an Ironwood Pickaxe or LV Miner to harvest cobalt ore.%n%nAnother way to get gallium and arsenic is with XP buckets in a crafting grid if you're really desperate.%n%nWith your EBF you can combine these two dusts to make a Gallium Arsenide Crystal.

gtnh.quest839.desc=Don't you hate having to manually compress all those tiny piles? Well, let me show you how to automate that. A combination of type filter, chest buffer (or super buffer in HV) and packager frees you from that annoying task. The chestbuffer can hold up to 9 stacks of tiny piles and the super buffer can hold 256 stacks of tiny dusts, which is more than enough. You can set its mode with a screwdriver on the output side. Set it to 9 to export 9 tiny piles at a time and let the packager compress these into regular dusts.%n%nSuper buffers can be lag sources, so be careful to keep them as empty as possible. If you're using a multiblock packager, be sure to change the buffer from Stocking mode to Transfer Size mode.

gtnh.quest939.desc=Your hoe must be getting worn out by now. Why not craft an electric one which never breaks?

# Quest.940 - §6§lCleanroom
gtnh.quest940.name=§6§lCleanroom
gtnh.quest940.desc=If you want to make more advanced (also cheaper!) circuits you'll need a cleanroom. The cleanroom is a multiblock between 3x4x3 and 15x15x15 (WxHxL) blocks. Besides plascrete blocks for all edges you'll need a controller in the top center, filter machine casings for the rest of the top except edges, an energy and maintenance hatch, a reinforced door (yes, this is always needed) and machine hulls if you want to automate. These are optional, for now, use them for power input, item input, and item output. Tier does not affect item transfer, so use the cheapest ones for that.%n%nLet's build a 5x5x5 room. Expanding it vertically is easy to do, or you can make it wider and longer, as long as both X and Z match and are odd. Up to 5% of the plascrete blocks can be replaced with Reinforced Glass to see into the cleanroom and check on machines.%n%nYou can pass materials through the walls using Machine Hulls. You can pass 1A of power using a Machine Hull as well, or you can use Diodes to pass multiple amps through.%n%nJust be really careful when upgrading your machines. Be sure to remove the machine hulls and diodes and replace them with the new power tier, or else you will be very sad. You don't need to do this for ones you only use to pass items through.%n%nIf the Cleanroom has maintenance issues, it will have a chance to void recipes needing a cleanroom (10% per maint issue!). Monitor your cleanroom with a Hand Scanner, Industrial Information Panel, or using a Needs Maintenance Cover and a Redstone Powered Light or Howler Alarm.%n%nAdditionally, the longer the door is open, the lower the efficiency will get, which has a direct correlation to recipe voiding. So open the door as little as possible! There are ways around this though, for example, with an elevator or travel anchor, you never actually need to open the door!%n%n§3Multiblocks such as the LCR, LPF, or PA count as cleanrooms, so you don't need to put them in one. You cannot use the bio lab in a PA, so you'll still need the cleanroom later on.%n%nOther helpful hints include: using a wireless connector for AE or a transvector interface to skip machine hulls, and that you can use higher tier energy hatches to reach 100% efficiency faster (does not use more power once at 100%).%n%n§cKeep in mind that you cannot use anything in the cleanroom that causes pollution or it will break down.

# Quest.941 - §6§lA Very Useful Scanner
gtnh.quest941.name=§6§lA Very Useful Scanner
gtnh.quest941.desc=The portable scanner is a tool capable of showing advanced information about almost every block in the game. In order to function, the tool needs to be charged first. It can hold up to 400k EU and accept 128 EU/t or less. This is MV tier.%n%nIt can scan crops by right clicking it to fully scan it, unlike a cropnalyzer which needs a seed bag in your inventory, and takes multiple goes. Crops that were scanned in the world will drop a scanned seed bag.%n%nIt can scan machines from GregTech, giving information about current progress, the stored energy, efficiency, problems and CPU-load - be sure to check the full chat window for additional details.%n%nFor any block in the game it scans, it gives information about its ID, Metadata, position in the world and hardness value. It also gives information about pollution level in the chunk the scanned block belongs to.%n%nIn addition it shows when the cleanroom has reached its 100 percent efficieny level.

# Quest.942 - §3§lIt's a Dirty Job, and You're Going to Do It

Only make this for things you need tons of, LV circuits are expensive after all.%n%nNow you can store the same amount of fluids a steel 5x5 Railcraft tank contains in a single block.%n%n§3%nA lot of nice functionality has been added to Super and Quantum tanks. You can now pick them up with a wrench without voiding the fluids! You will get heavy debuffs though, so better prepare some milk. If you actually want to void the fluids you can crouch while using the wrench.%n%nThey now also have optional automatic fluid output, fluid locking, overflow void mode, or full void mode. And all that with a nice and simple GUI. Quite the IMPACTful change I would say. 

# Quest.945 - §2§lChad - A Better Way to Make Paper
gtnh.quest945.name=§2§lChad - A Better Way to Make Paper
gtnh.quest945.desc=Making paper out of wood pulp and water can be tedious and difficult. Why not use a mortar to grind the sugar cane in to chad and press it with two stone slabs to paper? Later on you can use the chemical bath for a even better ratio.

# Quest.946 - §1§lBamboo Fence
gtnh.quest946.name=§1§lBamboo Fence
gtnh.quest946.desc=Maybe you're lucky and started off in a bamboo forest. Bamboo is a very useful tree since it grows really fast and when you break the bottom-most block, the whole thing comes apart. You can use them as sticks, or you can place the bamboo sticks and they will grow and protect your base behind a 3 block tall wall. Alternatively, you can also use Berry Bushes.

gtnh.quest948.desc=But not as good as steel. Mostly, this is used in machine hulls, or in tools if you don't want to use steel up for that.%n%nTo make wrought iron, you need a tinkers smelter to melt some iron ingots down and cast nuggets; or use an ingot and a saw to get your nuggets. Now put these in a furnace to get wrought iron nuggets. With the compressor, you can compress the nuggets into ingots.%n%n§3Hint: Crushed or purified iron ore (not a mixed version like pyrite, look for Iron Ore in Chalcopyrite veins) can be smelted to iron nuggets directly. Or you can use an alloy smelter to turn iron ingots into nuggets faster than a smeltery. You can also use a saw to cut up iron ingots into nuggets.%n%nLater on, you can use an arc furnace to make wrought iron ingots directly.%n%n

Frames to lower genetic decay will lower the chances of this happening.%n%nOf course, with very long lifespans, high production genes, swarmers, and tons of frames, you may think this is worth it.%n%nNote that normal products have a cap of 200% produced, and specialties 100%.

# Quest.1115 - Moron's Guide to Better Trees
gtnh.quest1115.name=Moron's Guide to Better Trees
gtnh.quest1115.desc=Forestry trees have a variety of attributes.  Once you get a tree with a useful attribute, you can breed that attribute into other tree species. This way you can get an ultimate tree that combines all the attributes you want - including the type of fruit! you can also extract the genes with Gendustry if you can make the machines.%n%nIT IS RECOMMENDED YOU DO YOUR FORESTRY TREE BREEDING IN AN ENCLOSED AREA, OR UNDERGROUND. BUTTERFLIES ARE A KNOWN LAG SOURCE.%n%nFor faster tree breeding, enclose your trees so that butterflies cannot escape, and breed bees with better traits for area and pollination speed. There's also frames too if you can afford it. The sieve may also help if you want to do it more exactly if you can make an alveary. §3PS: You need either bees or butterflies, trees won't pollinate each other. §r%n%n§eSaplings/Fertility§r: Chance of getting a sapling from a detroyed leaf.

Wider trees have more leaves and logs, but will also need more saplings to begin growing. All saplings must be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW corner determines the stats of the new tree, and is where bone meal must be applied to mature the tree. The Giant Sequoia is best here too.%n%nAllele/Size%n1x1%n2x2%n3x3%n4x4 %n%nYield: Chances of getting a fruit from a destroyed leaf.

Applies to the wood. Only the Coast and Giant Sequoia have this.%n%n§7Effect§r: All trees are None.%n%n========================================================================%n%n§2Growth§r: Sipiri trees have Tropical instead of Light, and can only be bred in a Biome with temperature 90%-190% and humidity 90%-200% and can only grow in 120%-190% temp and 90%-200% humidity. All other trees just need light to grow.%n%n§3Territory/Soil§r: All trees have Average, whatever that means. Probably something related to the below that never really got used.%n%n§eTolerates§r: If it can be planted on sand or not. Only Desert Acacia and Grandidier's Baobab have this. The trait is either Plains or Plains, Desert.%n%n§5Supports§r: What kind of fruits it can theoretically have. Determined by Species. Only fruits from families listed under this trait can be produced by the tree, regardless of what appears under the tree's §aFruits§r trait. There's a number of Extra Trees trees that support all 4 types, but none from Forestry itself.%n%n§aFruit§r: Determines what fruit or nut it produces. Each fruit/nut provides different advantages:%nPlum and Cherry Plum only produces 100L Fruit Juice, but have a 60% chance of producing Mulch in the Fluid Extractor or Squeezer.%nPapaya produces 600L Fruit Juice, but only has a 10% chance to produce Mulch.%nCoconuts produce 300L Seed Oil, but only have a 25% chance to produce Mulch.%nUse a forestry Multifarm so you don't have to break the leaf block to get the fruit/nut. Set it to Manual Orchard, and place everything first.%n%n§bFamily§r: Tells you what family of the fruit listed under the Fruits trait is: Pomes, Prunes, Nuts or Jungle.%n%n§4When breeding these trees for quests, you will need to breed the species "pure", not a hybrid. Fortunately, that's much easier for trees. You should probably save the crossbreeding 'till after you get all the good ones.

# Quest.1116 - Breed some cultivated bees
gtnh.quest1116.name=Breed some cultivated bees
gtnh.quest1116.desc=Common Princess and Foresty Drone can be bred to cultivated bees. %n%nCultivated bees have the shorest lifespan - this means they make great princesses to breed with your newly bred drones. The queen will die quickly, quickly giving genetic material to work with. Make sure the traits you want are kept!%n%nThey are also a Fast production bee, which means lots of honey combs for powering your Beealyzer or Treealyzer. %n%nCultivated Bees produce Honey Combs every 0.9 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time.%n%nMake sure your cultivated bees are pure with a Beealyzer or GT scanner.%n%nThe main bee breeding quests will require pure bees but you can use Ignoble or Pristine princesses.

# Quest.1117 - Breed some common bees
gtnh.quest1117.name=Breed some common bees
gtnh.quest1117.desc=To cross breed bees you need two different species of bees. One drone and one princess from different world-gen hives (Meadows and Forestry as an example)%n%nBee Houses do not allow crossbreeding. You need an Apiary to crossbreed them to a new species. Certain frames will help this process. Shortening their lifespan means faster crosses. Increasing Mutation rate means getting mutations and thus rare bees quicker.%n%nCommon Bees produce Honey Combs every 2.2 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time. %n%nMake sure your bees are pure by checking their genetics with a Beealyzer or GT scanner.

# Quest.1118 - Breed some noble bees
gtnh.quest1118.name=Breed some noble bees
gtnh.quest1118.desc=Cross breeding common and cultivated bees can result in noble bees. %n%nNoble bees produce dripping combs every 3.8 minutes and honeydew. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time. %n%nYou've heard of a drunk beekeeper saying he has perfected a method of creating proven frames using Honeydew and a little magic. It might be worth your time to try experimenting yourself.

# Quest.1119 - Dripping Combs
gtnh.quest1119.name=Dripping Combs
gtnh.quest1119.desc=Your noble bees produce some dripping combs.%nA good source for honey, and if have a magical mind, honeydew for proven frames.

# Quest.1120 - Breed some majestic bees
gtnh.quest1120.name=Breed some majestic bees
gtnh.quest1120.desc=Cross breeding noble and cultivated bees can result in majestic bees.%n%nIf you didn't get it from Wintry bees already, Majestic bees have a very important attribute - high fertility. They will leave 4 drones when they die. This means lots of genetic material for the next generation to work with.%n%nMajestic bees produce dripping combs every 1.5 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time.

# Quest.1121 - Breed some imperial bees
gtnh.quest1121.name=Breed some imperial bees
gtnh.quest1121.desc=Cross breeding noble and majestic bees can result in imperial bees.%n%nThese bees produce a Regeneration buff in their active area.  You can probably find a use for this in case of...accidents.%n%nImperial bees produce dripping combs every 3.8 minutes and royal jelly every 5.1 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time. %n%nRoyal jelly is needed in making scented paneling for an Alveary - the third tier bee housing.%n%nYou can now start working towards the Master Registry in the How to Be(e) tab.

# Quest.1122 - Royal Jelly
gtnh.quest1122.name=Royal Jelly
gtnh.quest1122.desc=Royal jelly is a honey bee secretion that is used in the nutrition of larvae, as well as adult queens. It is only produced by the imperial bee. It's production can be increased with proven frames or any other kind of frames except for the soul frame. Royal jelly is also useful because it can craft ambrosia, which fills 8 hunger points (4 full food icons) and gives Regeneration I for 40 seconds. Royal jelly is used to craft scented paneling which are required in the creation of alveary blocks.

# Quest.1123 - Alvearies
gtnh.quest1123.name=Alvearies
gtnh.quest1123.desc=The alveary is an advanced variant of the apiary. The alveary allows for combs to be produced faster due to its natural speed increase to production (as well as the ability to add up to six frames via the Extra Bees frame housings) and due to its ability to be modified by other blocks. %n%nIt is possible to adjust the internal temperature of the alveary using the alveary heater or alveary fan in order to accommodate bees that require hotter or colder climates.%n%nCertain bees will not produce their specialty items unless they are Jubilant. This requires matching their preferred Temperature/Humidity, without any genetic modifiers. Some bees also need a block of something beneath them as well.%n%nIt is also possible to use mutators to increase chances of mutation, alveary lighting and alveary rain shield to allow bees without the nocturnal and tolerant flyer traits to work during the night and rain, respectively, and the swarmer to use excess royal jelly to create princesses that last for a limited number of generations.%n%n§3If you're mutating bees that need a specific block in it, you need to place the required block under the middle bottom, and have the one directly above be a normal alveary block.

# Quest.1124 - §3§lBarrel Upgrades
gtnh.quest1124.name=§3§lBarrel Upgrades
gtnh.quest1124.desc=Are your cobblestone or dirt barrels filled to the brim? No problem, upgrade them!

# Quest.1125 - §3§lBarrel Upgrades Tier 2
gtnh.quest1125.name=§3§lBarrel Upgrades Tier 2
gtnh.quest1125.desc=Are your upgraded cobblestone or dirt barrels full again? No problem, upgrade them some more!

# Quest.1126 - §3§lAlumite
gtnh.quest1126.name=§3§lAlumite
gtnh.quest1126.desc=It's upgrade time again. You can make alumite like modpack Moron by mixing obsidian, steel and alumin(i)um in the smeltery, or you can be a GregTech hero and search NEI for an alternate recipe using dusts. Alumite pickaxes are able to mine ardite in the Nether.%n%nLeave the rest of your Alumite as liquid in your smeltery, you'll want it to make the Tool Forge. You need 16 ingots in the smeltery to make 2 Large Plates.

# Quest.1127 - §3§lReinforced X? Unbreakable
gtnh.quest1127.name=§3§lReinforced X? Unbreakable
gtnh.quest1127.desc=With your steel tool you are able to mine obsidian. Large obsidian plates give a reinforced modifier which increases the durability of your tool. Reinforced level X makes a tool unbreakable.%n%n§3PS: It's almost never worth it to use this, aside from for lumber axes, since the tools don't degrade that fast, it doesn't cost much to repair, and you get better materials (with higher durability) to make them out of reasonably fast. Plus, by the time you got it to unbreakable, you'd be auto-mining everything with a miner anyway. Just use redstone, or maybe luck/silky.

# Quest.1128 - §4§3§lLapis? Lucky!
gtnh.quest1128.name=§4§3§lLapis? Lucky!
gtnh.quest1128.desc=Maybe you were lucky and received the luck modifier on your pickaxe. If not, you may still have an unused modifier on your pick so you can add some lapis lazuli. Or you can perhaps add another modifier by adding a diamond and a gold block to your pick and then add some lapis. %n%nYou can put the lapis lazuli in more than one slot in the tool station, use blocks to raise the luck level faster, and even use lapis blocks in the crafting station with your tool for maximum luck gain.%n%n§3Since it only affects small ore it might not be worth it to you to use. Also, if you lack in lapis, you can put 1 point on, and then mine stuff, and it will sometimes gain more points, up to the 450 limit.

# Quest.1129 - §2§lRedstone? Haste!
gtnh.quest1129.name=§2§lRedstone? Haste!
gtnh.quest1129.desc=Mining and digging can be soooo slow. Get some redstone on your pick, shovel or axe to make it faster. You can use the Crafting Station to upgrade your tool 8 dust at a time. Later when you get a compressor you can use blocks to do 9 per block.

# Quest.1130 - §2§3§e§4§3§lExtra Modifier
gtnh.quest1130.name=§2§3§e§4§3§lExtra Modifier
gtnh.quest1130.desc=If you don't have an extra modifier on your tool you can easily add one. A gold block and a diamond are all you need.%n%nYou can add two more modifiers, but you'll need to read the tinkers book yourself to know what to use.

# Quest.1131 - §5§lArdite and Cobalt
gtnh.quest1131.name=§5§lArdite and Cobalt
gtnh.quest1131.desc=If you have some time you can look for cobalt and ardite in the Nether.%n%nYou've heard rumors of a special wood only found in another land, a forest of Twilight, that can make tools strong enough to mine them.%n%nRemember, you need an electric blast furnace to process these materials before you can make tools with them.

# Quest.1132 - §3§f§3§lNether Quartz? Sharpness!
gtnh.quest1132.name=§3§f§3§lNether Quartz? Sharpness!
gtnh.quest1132.desc=Your sword is too dull? Get some nether quartz to sharpen it.%n%nIf you have lots of Certus quartz, 1 piece of Certus is equal to 24 Nether quartz.

# Quest.1133 - §3§lSubmission Station
gtnh.quest1133.name=§3§lSubmission Station
gtnh.quest1133.desc=Although many of the questing tasks can be submitted directly through your inventory (including liquids) sometimes you need a more automated solution. This is where the Object Submission Station (OSS) comes in handy. %n%nTasks supporting the OSS can be selected through the built in interface to enable its use. Once setup, liquids and items can be either piped in or dropped into the interface's input slot. It will not void items or liquids if no task is selected or if it has already been completed, however, making it relatively safe from accidental item/fluid deletion. Multiple OSS are also capable of taking on separate sub-tasks under the same quest simultaneously!%n%n§3PS: No quests actually require this at the moment, so feel free to ignore it.

# Quest.1134 - §5§lLV Advanced Steam Boiler
gtnh.quest1134.name=§5§lLV Advanced Steam Boiler
gtnh.quest1134.desc=The LV GT++ Steam Boiler is the next machine you can build to produce steam more efficiently than with the High Pressure Boiler. It won't use fuel up unless it starts to run low on steam, so it's very efficient.

# Quest.1135 - §5§lULV Transformer
gtnh.quest1135.name=§5§lULV Transformer
gtnh.quest1135.desc=To get your simple ore washer working you need a ULV Transformer. The Washer can only work with 8 EU. If you put more energy into it you get a big hole in your base.%n%n§3This will probably be the only one you make in the game.

# Quest.1136 - §5§lLossless LV Cables
gtnh.quest1136.name=§5§lLossless LV Cables
gtnh.quest1136.desc=How about lossless 32 EU cables? Redstone alloy is a superconductor and will transfer your energy without any loss.%n%nRedstone Alloy is a new alloy which requires an EBF. Mix redstone, silicon and coal by hand, or in the mixer for a better result.%n%n§3Remember not to mix it up with Red Alloy, that's the ULV one.

# Quest.1137 - §9§lKinetic Power HV
gtnh.quest1137.name=§9§lKinetic Power HV
gtnh.quest1137.desc=The Kinetic Generator will transform mechanical energy into electricity. The EU output depends on the KU input. It is most commonly used together with a Kinetic Wind Generator or Kinetic Water Generator. The Kinetic Steam Generator only has one tier, so your should probably use a Steam Turbine instead.%n%nWhen placing a kinetic generator, any time, the "input" side is the side facing you.  So you will place the kinetic generator, then the wind/water/steam gen, and then place a rotor inside. Power can be drawn from any side of the kinetic generator, up to the rated amount per side. %n%nWARNING: Breaking a kinetic generator improperly will not return the generator.  Use a GT wrench, and right-CLICK it.  It should drop immediately.  Try again if it just changed directions. 

# Quest.1138 - §9§lKinetic Wind Power HV
gtnh.quest1138.name=§9§lKinetic Wind Power HV
gtnh.quest1138.desc=The Kinetic Wind Generator generates energy from wind power which varies randomly, although certain factors can change this.%n%nUnlike the Windmill, the Kinetic Wind Generator will require maintenance in the form of Rotors. These are needed to run the Kinetic Wind Generator.%nOnce a Rotor is placed inside the GUI, the block is given sufficient space, and the current wind level is adequate for the current rotor, the Kinetic Wind Generator will begin to generate Kinetic Energy. %n%nThis can be converted into EU by using a Kinetic Generator attached to the correct face (the black circle).%n%nAbout Wind%nFirst off, the wind strength of a particular area is affected by 3 factors: Height, Weather, and Chance. The higher up in the world you are, the higher the wind level. Below y64, there is never enough wind to be used, and KWG's will not function at all. Weather will also give boosts; Rainy weather will give a 20% boost to normal wind levels, and stormy weather will give a 50% boost. The final factor of chance makes the wind strength vary randomly, however there is a limited range of variation.%n%nThe easiest way to check the current wind level in an area is by using a Windmeter. Wind is strongest at around Y160, towards the build limit of Y255 there is very little wind, hence no point attempting to run Windmills that high. While inconvenient, the Wind Generator can run anywhere.

# Quest.1139 - §9§lKinetic Water Power HV
gtnh.quest1139.name=§9§lKinetic Water Power HV
gtnh.quest1139.desc=The Kinetic Water Generator allows Kinetic Units to be produced via the movement of water in river and ocean biomes. As with the Kinetic Wind Generator, it requires either Gearbox Rotor. Search NEI for appropriate options.%n%nIf the Kinetic Water Generator's Rotor isn't entirely submerged in water, it will alert you there is "no room for the rotor". If the Kinetic Water Generator isn't placed in a river, ocean or deep ocean biome, it will alert you it "must be placed in a river or ocean biome". Check the Game Mechanics spreadsheet on Discord for a list of biomes and their tags.%n%nWhile inconvenient, the Water Generator runs more consistently.%n%n§4You can use Witchery (for example) to convert biomes.

# Quest.1140 - §c§9§lRotor
gtnh.quest1140.name=§c§9§lRotor
gtnh.quest1140.desc=The Kinetic Wind and Water Generators need Gearbox Rotors to function. They can be added and removed with standard automation. Higher tier rotors will last longer. In addition, the iridium ones don't break. The IC2 ones might bug out for durability loss though. Energetic is probably the best for now, since it can give out a full amp, and more is wasted.%n%n§3You only need to make one rotor to complete this quest.

# Quest.1141 - §9§lWind Meter
gtnh.quest1141.name=§9§lWind Meter
gtnh.quest1141.desc=The Windmeter measures wind strength. It shows you on which height you can place your Wind Generator.

# Quest.1142 - §9§lHV Battery Buffers
gtnh.quest1142.name=§9§lHV Battery Buffers
gtnh.quest1142.desc=You'll probably want HV battery buffers as well.%n%n§3You only need to complete one task.

# Quest.1143 - §9§lHV Battery Hulls
gtnh.quest1143.name=§9§lHV Battery Hulls
gtnh.quest1143.desc=Better machines need better batteries. Let's make some HV battery hulls for new batteries.%n%nIt's up to you what kind of battery to make, but realistically you'll probably make Sodium or Lithium.

# Quest.1144 - §9§lHV Battery
gtnh.quest1144.name=§9§lHV Battery
gtnh.quest1144.desc=Better machines need some better batteries. Lithium is the best material to use when making batteries, at least for LV-HV.%n%n§3You only need to complete one task.

# Quest.1145 - §9§lSending the Power Back
gtnh.quest1145.name=§9§lSending the Power Back
gtnh.quest1145.desc=Kinetic generator compatibility has been improved so that you no longer need transformers, you can connect directly with a cable. But why not use your transformer to send the power back to base more efficiently, it's a loss of about 57/512EU per A just going from 160 straight down to 63 without it. If you transform up (after going through 1 block of cable to transform it to GT power), you only lose about 57/2048EU per A, much better.%n%n§4IC2 machines don't care about rain, but remember to cover your transformer.

# Quest.1146 - §2§lGT6-Styled Pipes
gtnh.quest1146.name=§2§lGT6-Styled Pipes
gtnh.quest1146.desc=Maybe you are wondering why the new pipes don't auto-connect anymore? This was changed to make the pipes smarter. You can now use a wrench to connect only the pipes you want. You don't need a plate or a foil to prevent pipes from connecting anymore.%n%nPipes transferring anything hotter than a certain amount (like steam) will cause damage to a player touching them. You'll want to cover hot pipes to prevent getting hurt if you want to walk over them. Also, if the heat level is higher than the pipe's heat capacity, it will melt.%n%nRight clicking on a pipe in the center of the 'grid' will enable or disable a connection. It will have an X through it if the connection is enabled. You can do the same to any of the 4 corners to adjust the opposite side. You can similarly connect each of the 4 sides by clicking on the closest box in the grid.%n%nAlso, pipes now come with a shutter built in for free to reduce sloshing. Shift-rightclick with a wrench on the side you want prevent input.%n%nPipes will attempt to transfer 1/2 of the capacity each second.%n%nLarge or Huge fluid pipes can be a poor man's storage tank, holding large amounts on their own.%n%nFor machine outputs, including the boilers, and RC water tanks (the one made of water tank siding), you will not need pumps. Other tanks will need pumps or Tinker's Construct faucets to move fluids.%n%nYou can put covers such as GT oak planks or plates on a pipe as well. Normally this prevents connections in that direction, but you can use a screwdriver to enable connections. This lets you make pipes that look nice going through walls. Use a crowbar to remove covers.%n%n§3Hint: If you click one pipe onto the other they will auto-connect.

# Quest.1147 - §3§2§4§3§lGT6-Styled Wires and Cables
gtnh.quest1147.name=§3§2§4§3§lGT6-Styled Wires and Cables
gtnh.quest1147.desc=They work basically the same as pipes, but you need wire cutters (or a soldering iron) instead of a wrench. Additionally, you take damage if they're not insulated (wire) but not if they are (cable).%n%nHint: If you click one wire or cable on the other it will auto-connect. Cables and pipes can be painted to make sure you do not cross your MV line with your EV line, or dump hot lava into your plastic water pipes. No boom today.%n%nHa ha just kidding there is always a boom today!

# Quest.1148 - §6§lTier 2 (MV)
gtnh.quest1148.name=§6§lTier 2 (MV)
gtnh.quest1148.desc=The next tier of machine hull needs aluminium. You're gonna need it for every machine and machine part for this tier, so keep that EBF truckin'.%n%nDid you remember to read the Safety First quest for details about mixing tiers? The most applicable part to remember here is that sending MV to an LV machine will cause it to explode. Sending MV voltage over LV cables causes them to melt, which causes a fire that can also cause an explosion. Additionally, recipes done in a tier higher than the original one (not ULV, ULV counts as LV) are overclocked. OC'd recipes use 4x power, and complete 2x faster.

# Quest.1149 - §5§lA New Alloy - Magnalium
gtnh.quest1149.name=§5§lA New Alloy - Magnalium
gtnh.quest1149.desc=Wondering why you need magnalium now? It's not for GT machines but for a material update for your crossbow.%n%nGo to the Twilight Forest and find an Olivine/Glauconite vein located at Y 10-40 or in the Overworld a Glauconite Soapstone mix located at Y 20-50 and a Granitic Mineral Vein in the Overworld Located at Y 50-60 (The Gypsum vein you will need for the Bricked Blast Furnace).%n%nWith your Ore Washer you can get Magnesium and Aluminium out of the Ores (Magnesite for Magnesium (marble can be used too) and Fullers Earth for Aluminium) and combine it in the Alloy smelter to get Magnalium.%n%nMagnesite gives 10 tiny piles of Magnesium each dust but fullers earth gives only a tiny pile of Aluminium.

# Quest.1150 - §5§lMagnalium Crossbow
gtnh.quest1150.name=§5§lMagnalium Crossbow
gtnh.quest1150.desc=It's time to craft a Crossbow Limb and the Crossbow Body to upgrade your old Wooden Crossbow.

# Quest.1151 - §3§lWooden Crossbow
gtnh.quest1151.name=§3§lWooden Crossbow
gtnh.quest1151.desc=Now you are able to make a better long range weapon - a crossbow. Use wood for the the crossbow limb and the body and use obsidian (Reinforced III) for the tough binding. Normal strings for the bowstrings would be enough for now.%n%nAssemble the bow yourself on your tool forge.%n%n§4For upgrades:%n§5§4§3Redstone - Speed on the draw%nLapis - Fortune on kills%nMoss - Self-repair (this is not visible in NEI until you unlock it in the GTNH Thaumcraft tab)%n%n§6NOTE: Some mobs require damage from specific tools. IF YOU ARE SHOOTING AT SOMETHING AND IT IS NOT GETTING HURT, *RUN*. And then figure out what weapon might be best to kill it.

# Quest.1152 - §5§lFiery Bowstring
gtnh.quest1152.name=§5§lFiery Bowstring
gtnh.quest1152.desc=Why not upgrade your bowstring too? You got some from the last quest, but will need to find some more in the Nether by killing spiders. Craft some fiery bowstring with it.

# Quest.1153 - §5§lArdite Crossbow Body
gtnh.quest1153.name=§5§lArdite Crossbow Body
gtnh.quest1153.desc=To make your crossbow even better, craft an ardite crossbow body. You received a few ardite ingots as reward before but will need to find ore in the Nether and process it in an Electric Blast Furnace.%n%nWith redstone you can make your bow faster. This requires a free modifier slot on your crossbow.%n%nDon't bother putting Nether Quartz on the crossbow, it only improves damage from whacking mobs over the head with it. Put the Nether Quartz on your bolts instead.

# Quest.1154 - §5§lMagnalium Crossbow Bolts
gtnh.quest1154.name=§5§lMagnalium Crossbow Bolts
gtnh.quest1154.desc=Magnalium bolts are much better than your old wooden bolts.%n%nYou can use nether quartz on the bolts to make them even better.

gtnh.quest1201.desc=Your fancy new Large Plasma Turbine will need a rotor to go inside of it. %n%nYou can make it out of any GT material, but the best right now is NORMAL Draconium. §4Always test in Creative first!§r%n%nWhen using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Plasma Turbines being the best at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 250% of optimal flow to produce 158% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 400% of optimal flow to produce 214% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 550% of optimal flow to produce 301% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.%n%nThe choice is yours!%n%n§3For a lot of extra information on fusion, check out the new quest line called Powerful Nuclear Physics.

# Quest.1212 - §l§c§lStarting Fusion
gtnh.quest1212.name=§l§c§lStarting Fusion
gtnh.quest1212.desc=Now that your power needs are increasing, you need a way to keep up with demand. To generate over 1A ZPM with a single machine you have two options: solars, and fusion.%n%nWhile solars are simpler to set up, solars cap out at 524288 EU/t. Fusion can reach levels close to eight times that with the right setup. %n%nFor your first reactor, you will need a controller, 2-16 fluid input hatches, 1-16 fluid output hatches, and 16 energy hatches. All hatches have to be LuV tier or better. Each hatch provides 2048 EU/t for the recipe, and has a storage capacity of 10M eu. %n%nThis means you can do any fusion recipe that takes less than 32768 EU/t or less, and has a startup cost of 160M EU or less. Using more fluid hatches means you need less fusion casings. While this doesn't matter as much for the mk1 reactor, this principle helps tremendously with the higher reactor tiers.

The daytime on the moon lasts from a full moon to the next new moon (4 Overworld days, equaling 1h 20min) and, logically, the nighttime lasts from the new moon to the next full moon.%n%nSince the 1st Overworld night is full moon, you can safely land within the 1st 4 Overworld days, and then the next 4 Overworld days are more dangerous since hostile mobs will be able to spawn in the dark, and so on. If you miscount, the moon phases can tell you when it is daytime or nighttime on the moon. Full moon is the start of the moon day, new (or dark) moon is the start of the moon night.%n%nDuring the nighttime, the environment light levels get very low, allowing hostile mobs to spawn on the surface.

# Quest.1450 - Astro Miner
gtnh.quest1450.name=Astro Miner
gtnh.quest1450.desc=The Astro Miner is an automatic mining vehicle which moves around, making tunnels and mining up everything it finds, and brings it all back to a base station where it docks. It is not player-rideable so don't try and climb inside it!%n%n§3Surprisingly this actually works, contrary to what the wiki page says about GT ores. It's very very very stupid though. Also, slow. And it seems to discard half or more of the ore. Consider using it if you want the huge amount of planet blocks it will pick up instead of ore (for the most part).

# Quest.1451 - Astro Miner Base
gtnh.quest1451.name=Astro Miner Base
gtnh.quest1451.desc=To construct the dock, place 8 Astro Miner Base blocks in a cube, 2 blocks high, 2 blocks wide and 2 blocks deep. When the last of the base blocks is placed, it should automatically convert into an Astro Miner Base.

Next step is to set up the Frequencies in both Launch Controllers (i.e. Set: A to target B, B to target A). Have a look at Launch Controller to setup the automated launch. The first time you have to right-click the Cargo rocket and press launch at the top right corner.%n%n§4The Launch Controller has been modified to provide additional functionality. If you launch from a Launch Pad with the Launch Controller set up properly, the countdown will be greatly reduced, and you will teleport directly to the receiving Launch Pad. It will use half the rocket's fuel up though. This is very useful on laggy servers.

# Quest.1462 - Thermal Cloth
gtnh.quest1462.name=Thermal Cloth
gtnh.quest1462.desc=Thermal Padding is a set of garments made out of an advanced insulating material. The garments are able to keep a player from freezing to death in the cold environments of Outer Space. They are also able to keep the player from suffering heat exhaustion in an overly hot environment.%n%nThe temperature indicator on the Life Support HUD will show if the player is becoming too hot or too cold - as the temperature approaches dangerous levels, an "Invalid Thermal Protection" warning will be shown. On Mars and the Asteroids, simply wearing a full set of Thermal Padding should be enough to fix this.%n%n§3You'll also need some Silicon Rubber.

# Quest.1463 - Sleeping in Space
gtnh.quest1463.name=Sleeping in Space
gtnh.quest1463.desc=The Cryogenic Chamber is used to sleep on other planets and skip long nighttimes. It can be used at any time, even during the daytime, and in any dimension, including the Overworld.%n%nUsing the chamber during the daytime will skip the time to the next sunrise, except on the Asteroids dimension where the Sun is always locked on West.%n%nOnce the player has used the Cryogenic Chamber, there is a 300 seconds cool-down time before he can use the chamber again. Breaking and placing back the chamber or trying to use different chamber will not reset the cool-down time, unless by dying.%n%nThe chamber does not require energy to work.

# Quest.1464 - Arc Lamp
gtnh.quest1464.name=Arc Lamp
gtnh.quest1464.desc=The Arc Lamp is a very bright lamp. It is directional - meaning the light it casts is brighter in the direction it is facing. Its facing can be rotated using a standard Wrench.%n%nIncluding the Arc Lamp the brightness of blocks which are close to light sources is:%n%nRedstone Torch: 3-6%nTorch: 9-12%nBlock of Glowstone: 10-13%nArc Lamp: 13-14%n%nThe Arc Lamp can light up a fairly large area - for example a whole room - at light level 14: it is almost as bright as full sunlight.%n%nThe Arc Lamp also has the interesting property of actively repelling mobs. Not only does its light prevent mobs from spawning nearby, but it is so bright that if a mob comes close to the Arc Lamp the mob will turn around and walk away again. This mob repellant effect is confirmed to work on: Zombies, Skeletons, Creepers, Evolved Zombies, Evolved Skeletons, Evolved Creepers. It may also work on other types of mobs (confirmation required). But it has no effect on Spiders (they are not afraid of sunlight either) or boss mobs.

# Quest.1465 - Airlocks
gtnh.quest1465.name=Airlocks
gtnh.quest1465.desc=An airlock is an airtight door used to provide a passage between enclosed rooms and between an enclosed room and outer space. It is made from Air Lock Frames and one Air Lock Controller.%n%nThe airlock will keep air inside the room while it is closed.

# Quest.1466 - Temperature Control
gtnh.quest1466.name=Temperature Control
gtnh.quest1466.desc=The Ambient Thermal Controller is an item for use in the Oxygen Sealer to provide thermal protection in sealed spaces.%n%nAn Ambient Thermal Controller is useful in the dimensions too cold or too hot for players to survive without Thermal Padding.%n%nIt can be placed in the 3rd slot next to the energy and oxygen slots in a working Oxygen Sealer. Once the Ambient Thermal Controller is in the sealer, it will heat or cool the output oxygen according to the local environment, and then the player can safely take the thermal padding off in the sealed room. Though there's absolutely no reason to do so.

# Quest.1467 - Oxygen Sealer
gtnh.quest1467.name=Oxygen Sealer
gtnh.quest1467.desc=The Oxygen Sealer is a machine that fills a room with oxygen (although the oxygen is generally not visible) up to around 800-1000 blocks (the amount stacks with multiple sealers within close proximity) allowing the user to breathe without Oxygen Gear. Unlike the Oxygen Bubble Distributor, the Oxygen Sealer confines the oxygen to the room it is in. The sealer must be supplied with power and sufficient oxygen. See Oxygen Collector for supplying oxygen.%n%nThe sealer will only work in a room that is completely sealed off from outer space. This can be achieved with either a completely closed off room, or with an Air Lock. The sealer must have nothing above it to block its vents. It is designed to check for a proper seal about every 5 seconds, so be sure to give it time to seal.%n%nEach sealer requires at least 320 air points per second to work continuously or it will fail.

gtnh.quest1470.desc=Cavernous Vine is a poisonous plant that grows naturally in the Mars underground. It grows from the ceiling down to the floor in the huge caves flooded with Bacterial Sludge, emits light and can trap mobs in it.%n%nAny mob that touches this plant will be poisoned, dragged up and lose health down to 1 health point (half a heart) while trapped in this plant. Mobs that are immune to poison, like Zombies and Skeletons, will not lose health.%n%nThey grow from the bottom face of a solid block down to 1 block away from the floor.%n%nCavernous vines can be broken by hand without taking damage or being poisoned but they will drop nothing. They can be obtained as an item using shears. Even picks with Silk Touch enchant will not obtain anything.%n%nOnce obtained, they can be replanted elsewhere and regrow, like cactus.%n%n§3That said, they're still useless.

# Quest.1471 - Slimeling
gtnh.quest1471.name=Slimeling
gtnh.quest1471.desc=The Slimeling is a utility mob that spawns from Slimeling Eggs found on the surface of Mars. It shares some features from vanilla wolves and mules: it can be tamed and attacks mobs that threaten its owners, and can be equipped with a special chest to transport items.%n%nAs an allied mob, Slimelings will actively help and follow the player-owner and will attempt to protect them. They can also have a neutral behavior, that is, they can attack if provoked or hurt by non-owners.%n%nItems that you can feed Slimelings with:%n%nBoat%nCooked fish%nGunpowder%nGold ingot%nRedstone repeater%nWooden door%n%nSlimelings can be equipped by their owners with a Slimeling Inventory Bag to transport items.%n%nTo complete this quest get any one of the eggs - note you may need a Heavy Duty Pickaxe.

# Quest.1472 - Grapple
gtnh.quest1472.name=Grapple
gtnh.quest1472.desc=The Grapple is a grappling hook and rope which can be thrown by a player, and then used to swing the player in the direction it was thrown. Useful for reaching places that are otherwise too high to jump to, or traveling around the Asteroids. §3(Or just, you know, §ofly§r§3.)§r%n%nRight-click to aim the Grapple at a block you want to reach, similar to aiming a Bow. Release the right-click - similar to firing an arrow from a bow - to grapple yourself in that direction.%n%nFor best results, aim the Grapple at a point 1 or 2 blocks higher than the point you want to reach.%n%nIf there is no safe platform to land at that point, you can fall back down and you will take fall damage, so it takes some skill to use the Grapple safely.%n%nTake care using the Grapple near a Nether Portal, End Portal or at a low height (less than Y30) on a Space Station. There can be strange consequences if it crosses into another dimension.

# Quest.1473 - Nice and Comfortable - in Space!
gtnh.quest1473.name=Nice and Comfortable - in Space!

Make sure to send it out for cleaning after you're done.%n%nAfter it decays you can electrolyze radon out of it.%n%n§3You only need to do one task.

# Quest.1481 - What Was That? I Can't Hear You Over the Engine!
gtnh.quest1481.name=What Was That? I Can't Hear You Over the Engine!
gtnh.quest1481.desc=The Extreme Combustion Engine is an upgrade to the Large Combustion Engine, the IV version that needs Tungstensteel instead of Titanium. The structure is essentially the same, and it's almost a 1:1 ratio between the two materials, so this is a good generator when you've accumulated several stacks of Tungsteensteel.%n%nThe caveat is that it only accepts High Octane Gasoline. This is the last and most powerful type of combustion fluid made from Oil, and it has the longest processing line of them all. As a reward, it has an excellent §e§b§a2.5M EU per bucket§a§r, and you can burn it here alongside some Liquid Oxygen for almost §a4 IV amps per tick.%n%n§cThe Liquid Oxygen is very important, because it greatly boosts the speed of the multi and the fuel efficiency as well. §f§rIt needs 40 L/s, so you will need more than one Vacuum Freezer to supply it continuously: for an ECE that is always running, you will need a double Vacuum Freezer, 1 EV and 1 HV. You can run less freezers if you overclock them, if the ECE isn't working all the time or if you upgrade to a Cryogenic Freezer,

# Quest.1482 - §5§6§lPortable Prospecting Tool
gtnh.quest1482.name=§5§6§lPortable Prospecting Tool
gtnh.quest1482.desc=Now that you have some tech, you've discovered a way to prospect for ores. This tool only has a chance at finding the ores in a chunk. If you are clever, you can use it to locate ores.%n%nUnfortunately, the tech to make it repairable or rechargeable doesn't work, so you'll have to make a new one each time it breaks. It does work better at higher tiers and lasts longer with better materials.%n%nIt doesn't make a convenient book like the Seismic Prospector, but you can look at the results of scanning on the map, thanks to Visual Prospecting.%n%nIt can be hard to choose a good material for the Basic Prospector. Here are some good choices for you in their respective tiers, the size searched, and the average amount of veins they can scan:%n%nLV Vanadiumsteel 3x3 - 50%nMV Vanadiumsteel 3x3 - 213%nHV Vibrant Alloy 5x5 - 299%nEV Shadow Metal 7x7 - 1080%nIV Oriharukon 7x7 - 2649%n%nEach chunk successfully scanned costs 100 durability. Each failed chunk costs 25. The average for MV is ~55 per chunk when scanning a large area. As you can see, the prospectors become better and better with each tier, so craft one whenever you think you need it.%n%nGood luck.

# Quest.1494 - §6§f§6§lStainless Taking Too Long?
gtnh.quest1494.name=§6§f§6§lStainless Taking Too Long?
gtnh.quest1494.desc=Time for a second EBF! %n%nYou can make ingots faster in 3 ways - better coils, higher tier energy hatches, or adding more furnaces. It's probably time to add a second EBF to your base.%n%nMultiblock machines can share casings, mufflers, and input/output hatches/busses, but not maintenance hatches (you can share the auto ones though). You can share energy hatches, but only if you can supply enough power to all machines it's a part of. So if you have two EBFs that both want MV power, and you use a MV Energy Hatch, it won't work, since neither will get enough power. This is almost never used, so don't worry about it. Also, if you want to share inputs on Processing Arrays, turn off recipe map filtering on the busses.%n%nRemember, pollution will be very high with two EBFs active at once! Watch out for high pollution effects. Use the best mufflers available and don't place the EBFs in the same chunk as farmland or other high pollution machines like Pyrolyse Ovens and Large Boilers.%n%nYou can use whatever coils you have lying around, but you might want to start searching for Mica if you haven't found any yet.

# Quest.1496 - §2§lHow the Heck Do I Find Ores?
gtnh.quest1496.name=§2§lHow the Heck Do I Find Ores?
gtnh.quest1496.desc=GregTech ore generation is based on veins. Veins are centered on orecenters, based on the chunk number. Look at upper left of the screen to find the chunk number. Those infos are displayed by InGame Info XML mod. It has some useful info, but for now you need to see chunk info like "Chunk X: 3 Z: -2".%n%nThe 3,-2 is the chunk's address. Ignore the negative sign.  Now, the orecenters are located at 3N+1 chunks.  So, 4,7 is an orecenter. 10,16. -22,19.  Etc. %nProtip: to find out if a number is divisible by 3, add the digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3.  So 86 = 8+6 = 14. So you need to go down 1 chunk or up 2 chunks so that you are on a 3N+1 chunk.%n%nFor reading all the way, I'll give you an ingot of iron.%n%n§6TLDR: There's an ore vein every 3 chunks. Look in the upper left to see if you're over one.%n%n§3They have nothing to do with biomes, ok?

Our fancy bartimaeusnek developer has added a nifty feature to NEI that shows you where to find ores! Simply look for the oreblock in NEI, and click on it for info on where to find that ore.%n%nThere are many types of ores, even just for getting one material like Iron. So don't stick to only one type.%n%nYou can also search small ores, but not all of them are used.

# Quest.1499 - §5§lChemical Bath
gtnh.quest1499.name=§5§lChemical Bath
gtnh.quest1499.desc=Wait, what? You want more byproducts from your ores? A cheaper way to make paper? Well, the chemical bath is perfect for you! %n%nYou'll have to provide liquids like mercury to extract different products like nickel, silver, copper, and platinum (only as PMP) from ores. %n%nFor paper you'll only need some water and wood pulp. Maybe you'll find more uses for it!

# Quest.1500 - §1§lBetter Questing?
gtnh.quest1500.name=§1§lBetter Questing?
gtnh.quest1500.desc=Better Questing has a number of commands, I'll list the useful ones here so ya'll can stop asking on discord. Note that you need to have cheats enabled to use them.%n%nIf your world does not have cheats enabled, there's a workaround: On the ESC screen, open to LAN, then enable cheats. This makes pausing impossible, so consider reloading your world after. If you are using a personal server, you can do the command on the command line, without the /. You can also edit the level.dat file, and set 'allowCommands' to 1. Make sure to make a backup first, and use NBTExplorer or a similar program to do so.%n%n§l/bq_admin edit§r%nTurns on edit mode so you can edit quests, like me. You can use it to §6see all the quests and their requirements§r, but §6View Mode§r button is quicker and usable on multiplayer. Hover over a quest to see the requirements, and ID, if you've enabled extended tooltips with F3 + H (outside of the QB).%n%n§l/bq_admin reset all <Player>§r%nResets ALL quests. Use this if you want to start over, or are editing the QB. You should define the player as well if it's a server, otherwise you can skip that part.%n%n§l/bq_admin reset <number> <Player>§r%nResets a specific quest, defined by the number. It may be easier to go into edit mode and use the designer tool to specify which to reset in SP though.%n%n§l/bq_admin complete <number> <Player>§r%nCompletes a specific quest, similarly to above. You can still claim the rewards. §6Use this if a quest is broken, and then report it on GitHub!§r After checking if it's already reported of course.%n%n§l/bq_admin default load§r%nReloads the quest database from the file. Your save has a version of the QB that it stores that can be different from the one in the file. §6Use this command after updating the pack to update the QB!§r%n%n§l/bq_admin default save§r%nSaves changes to the QB after editing it. Make sure to turn edit mode off first and reset all quests, because it saves both of those.%n%n§l/bq_admin hardcore§r%nEnables BQ3 Hardcore Mode. You only start with 3 lives, so best of luck. Additional life hearts are available in the Kill all the Things tab.%n%n§l/bq_copyquests <PlayerWithQuestsCompleted> <NewPlayer>§r%n§6Syncs quests with another player.§r If someone joins your party and you don't want to help them through all the quests, use this. They do not gain any rewards from the quests!%n%nAbout Party Syncing: Party syncing works, but if you have someone join later, you'll need to help them go through all the quests first. This is mostly annoying in the first two ages, as they're mostly crafting tasks, instead of retrieval you can just have them pick up. You always need to do consume tasks separately though. %n%n§4For quests to save properly, you must be online and logged into your Mojang account when starting the game. Sorry, it's a limitation of Better Questing.§r

# Quest.1501 - §1§lBackup Your Stuff...
gtnh.quest1501.name=§1§lBackup Your Stuff...
gtnh.quest1501.desc=AromaBackup is included with the pack. Adjust the settings as you like (frequency, number of backups to keep, etc). You can also use another mod like FTB Utilities, or even an external program. Try not to use more than one, or it'll just use up disk space and CPU power for no reason.%n%nIf you need to restore from a backup, the AB ones are found in the backups folder in the instance directory, not the world save directory.%n%nRemember though, JourneyMap and Thaumcraft Node Tracker information isn't included with AromaBackup, so you should backup your journeymap and tcnodetracker directories yourself if you don't trust them or are moving data to another drive or computer. Also, the Thaumcraft data is a little buggy, losing scanned aspect data and Thaumonomicon data, so consider backing up that file as well, the file is the 'saves\<worldname>\playerdata\<nameofplayer>.thaum' file.

# Quest.1502 - §9§lTesla Would be Proud
gtnh.quest1502.name=§9§lTesla Would be Proud
gtnh.quest1502.desc=Tired of sticking your EnderIO items in the capacitor bank to charge it? Time to make a wireless charger.

# Quest.1503 - §6§lNobody Wants an Explosion...
gtnh.quest1503.name=§6§lNobody Wants an Explosion...
gtnh.quest1503.desc=...right? So when building multiblocks, make sure you%n%n1. Don't cross chunk boundaries with the multiblock.%n%n2. Don't rely on resources coming from outside the chunk to prevent explosions. In other words, make sure you source your water locally.%n%nAlso, if you haven't discovered it yet, Electric machines don't like getting rain or snow on them. They'll start fires, and those fires have a chance of causing an explosion. This explosion will explode other machines, cascading until your whole base is a hole in the ground. This is one of the reason backups are a thing. Stay safe out there!%n%nGood luck.%n%n§3BTW, there's also an Explosion.log file in the logs folder that tracks what caused an explosion if you're unsure. It appears to reset on world load though.

# Quest.1504 - §2§e§k§l§r§3§2§lDivine Rod of the Gods?
gtnh.quest1504.name=§2§e§k§l§r§3§2§lDivine Rod of the Gods?
gtnh.quest1504.desc=The ore finder rod takes some of the tedium out of finding an ore.  You'll need to find some first to make it, but once you have it you can use ore blocks to find more ore. It only tells you if that specific ore is nearby. Later you will want to return with better digging tools and check every spot.%n%nBe sure to use your NEI skills to figure out which ore block is the best choice for your needs. Other basic ore blocks can be purchased from the Coins tab.%n%nTo use, shift click when looking at the ground to open inventory and put the ore block into the slot. It has a 60 block range both up and down, this may miss redstone or graphite veins if they're very deep (Y5) and you're not at sea level (Y63).%n%n§3PS: It appears to work based off of GT's 'Material' system, so anything of the same material will work. Ie: an ingot, gem, plate, ore block, whatever. Anything that doesn't have a Material, it appears to search only for that block. You can't search for clay blocks with clay balls for instance.%n%n§rAs you get close, you will see and hear a response from the ore finder tool. You will see the wand tilt down when it discovers a match. Watch out - it will respond to small ores as well as normal ores so for Lapis and Redstone you will want to wait for large signal before digging. If it detects a large quantity of the ore you're looking for the wand will flip upside down completely. If you play with your sound on you will hear an obvious sound to notify you as well. The wand works in both your inventory and hotbar and you don't need to be actively holding it, though you get style points if you are holding it.%n%n§3You can craft magnetic iron rods by combining an iron rod with some redstone.%n%nAlso, because of the magical nature of the wand, the ore is stored with the player, not the wand. If you want to give the wand to someone else, remove the ore first.%n%n§4It doesn't work in space! The vast cosmic energies of the sun interfere with it's inner workings. Or we want you to use something more complicated than a stick, you choose.

# Quest.1505 - §2§lNot Enough Items - Now with Bookmarks!
gtnh.quest1505.name=§2§lNot Enough Items - Now with Bookmarks!
gtnh.quest1505.desc=More like too many items! Here are some tips for using NEI.%n%nWhen you have your inventory open, you can type the search terms in the text bar at the bottom. Make sure your GUI size is set correctly, or you won't be able to see it. Double-click the bar to highlight any matching items in your inventory or inventories you're looking at. Handy for searching for a specific ore, as they tend to look the same!%n%nEven better, you can use T to search nearby inventories, which will emit some particles. %n%nWe have also provided the special Y command to look for a machine in the world, in case you've forgotten where you placed that Advanced Circuit Assembler.%n%nWe now have an extra-fancy Bookmark feature! The default key is A, but can be changed in the NEI config window. Bookmarks will be on the left side of the inventory, and you can use R and U on the bookmarks to see the recipes or uses for that item, as normal.%n%nPushing O will hide NEI, useful for fancy screenshots.

# Quest.1506 - §2§lNEI Is More Powerful Than You Imagine
gtnh.quest1506.name=§2§lNEI Is More Powerful Than You Imagine
gtnh.quest1506.desc=NEI has some really nice advanced features too.%n%nClick on an item to see the recipe to create it, and press Backspace to go back to the previous recipe. %n%nHold Shift to stop the oredict cycling through items, and to show the oredict entries for the current item under your cursor.%n%nSearch using #oredict to find items that match that oredict; for example, #dyewhite will list all white dyes.%n%nUse * (asterisk) as a wildcard. For example #pipe*bronze will show you bronze pipes of all sizes.%n%nSearch using @mod. to find all items from that mod; for example, @mod.thaumcraft will list all thaumcraft items and blocks. Note that you need the whole name before it works.%n%nYou can even search a subset now with the right text. @mod.thaumcraft->table will search for anything with table in the name, in the mod thaumcraft. %n%n@thaumcraft and @thaumcraft-> will also search for anything from the mod thaumcraft, but only if the name is set correctly on the tooltip of the item. They basically always are though.%n%nIt has even more advanced features than mentioned here, you should check the web for details. Or just play around with the options.

# Quest.1507 - §4§3§lMaking a List, Checking it Twice
gtnh.quest1507.name=§4§3§lMaking a List, Checking it Twice
gtnh.quest1507.desc=As your base grows, you're going to have a dozen different long term goals each with many steps. Build a clipboard to keep track of what you need to do.%n%n§4Hint: You can put the clipboard on a wall using Shift-Rightclick.

gtnh.quest1508.desc=Tired of your stuff falling out of your crafting table every time you walk away?  This fancy table from Tinker's Construct has slots to hold the items in your recipe. %n%nYou can also use it to upgrade tools with 8 modifiers at a time. Very handy for additional speed or looting!%n%nWhen it's placed next to a vanilla chest, it will even show the chest's inventory in the crafting window. Single or double vanilla chests only please.%n%nCut it again for a sleek, low profile version.

# Quest.1510 - §5§lBiomes Everywhere, But Not the One You Want?
gtnh.quest1510.name=§5§lBiomes Everywhere, But Not the One You Want?
gtnh.quest1510.desc=Tired of searching all over the map for that Bamboo Forest or Tropical Rainforest? Desperate for clay dust and need to find a Canyon or Mesa biome? Nature's compass will lead you to the biome you're looking for, if it's within range.%n%nSome things to keep in mind:%n1) Biomes from other dims show up on the list, don't bother searching those unless you're in that dim%n2) Radius 10000 means it couldn't find it%n3) You can try again at a different location and you might find it, the range is 10K too. There's also a config setting for those who don't mind the freeze when searching%n4) Artificially created biomes count, so remove them if you want to find a natural one%n5) There's lots of different 'versions' of biomes under the same category, so if you want a tropical one for tropical bees, there's actually a bunch of places you can get it.

gtnh.quest1515.name=Are the Bees Buzzing, or Screaming?
gtnh.quest1515.desc=These frames cause mutations at an increased rate. They're super useful.%n%nAbout the stats on frames you see when holding shift, you'll note that some have a different number in brackets next to them, this means that this is the maximum they can be stacked. this only applies to the Extra Bees ones.%n%nThe stats on the frames are also multiplicative instead of additive, so after 4 frames in an alveary, soul frames will max out. On the other hand, accelerated frames will take 9 to get there, but you can just keep on going.%n%nIf you pile up the multipliers, 5x from stimulator, 3x from mutator, and 4x1.8x frames, it'll get you to 157x, getting you those 1% bees in a single generation!

# Quest.1541 - Analyze Your Crops
gtnh.quest1541.name=Analyze Your Crops
gtnh.quest1541.desc=The cropnalyzer is a powered tool used to analyze IC2 crop seedbags. Charge it by placing it in an MV machine; recommended to put an MV battery in it as well to keep it full. To fully analyze a seed bag, you will need to put it through the cropnalyzer four times. If the crop is already planted, it is better to analyze it with the portable scanner instead of breaking it just to scan it - you have a chance of losing the seed every time you break it.%n%nThe cropnalyzer also has a feature called the IC2 Crop Calculator, where you can find the mix of outputs of breeding together any crops. To access the calculator, hit the IC2 side inventory key while holding the cropnalyzer.  You can select any crops available and discover what plants have decent percentages of a result. And no, you can't do the reverse, search for the crops.zip on discord for that (it doesn't have micadia though).%n%nYou can choose up to four crops to breed together. Then click "process" and the bottom row will show the possible crossbreeding outputs, and their weights. You can use the + and - gui buttons to scroll through the row(s) of crops. You can also use a button in the GUI to sort the rows by tier or weight. You can invert the sorting by hitting the sorting button while holding shift.%n%nWhen trying to get a specific crop, you generally want to maximize its percentage. Do this by breeding 2-4 of the same plant together (more is faster). There is no advantage to crossing plant types, it just reduces the % chance of getting what you want, contrary to what you might think.%n%nUse the crops guide at https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-Crops for more details.%n%nA large field of stickreeds has a good chance at making lots of valuable crosses. This is because it's decently high tier (they randomly mutate to tiers nearby mostly), and it's really fast, so you can get it to a high stat fast, which you should probably do first. Mutations are random, you can get transformium from stickreed, so keep that in mind. You do tend to get similar crops, so if you want metals, get the metal crops for example. Go to the wiki or spreadsheet (not up to date) to see the attributes that govern similarity.

# Quest.1542 - Crop Automation
gtnh.quest1542.name=Crop Automation
gtnh.quest1542.desc=The Crop-Matron is a LV machine that will monitor crops in a 11x11x3 area and automatically apply fertilizer, Weed-EX, and Water as needed. Water can be pumped in directly or use IC2 Universal water cells, normal cells aren't returned when they're used.%n%nThe Crop-Matron is rainproof, but make sure you cover up your power supply (you might find a fancy way to do this), or use an LV battery.  A Lithium Ion will last about 2 hours. %n%nTilled dirt still requires a nearby water block to be hydrated as the Matron will only water the crop, not the soil. Try putting a lily pad on top so it isn't annoying to walk on, or using Garden Soil instead.

# Quest.1543 - Weed Ex
gtnh.quest1543.name=Weed Ex
gtnh.quest1543.desc=Weed-EX is used to prevent the growth of Weeds on empty Crop blocks at the cost of some weed-EX. Damage to the crop's quality is illusory, and not true. We have people that have looked at the code, we assure you. §oUnless§r it counts as a weed (venomilia Gr 8+, any other crop Gr 24+), then it loses maybe 1 stat. Maybe. And you can just increase it again too. And it might not take effect even then if you don't apply too much, like a crop matron won't.%n%nUsage:%nWhile holding Weed-Ex, right-click on a Crop to apply it. It can also be placed in a Crop-Matron to automatically apply it to your crops.

You will also need an energy hatch, an input hatch, and an output bus - at least MV but you can choose.%n%nLater you can upgrade the ore drilling plant so it extracts from more than a 48 block radius. If you don't want to mine that far away, adjust the range with a screwdriver. Each tier of the controller also gives 1 bonus fortune for small ores starting at 4. At tier 3 you'll want to spread the wealth to multiple compressed chests!%n%nThe multiblock miners have been upgraded so that they will chunkload the area they dig in. They will NOT chunkload themselves however. They will dig §odown§r in the chunk they're in like normal, and then dig §oup§r one chunk at a time in other chunks within its range.%n%nYou need mining pipes in the controller and drilling fluid in the fluid hatch. You can also feed mining pipes into an input bus.%n%nYou'll need to make lots of Drilling Fluid. 64 is a tiny amount to get started with! Plan to make thousands of buckets - perhaps onsite, or pumped in via Long Distance Fluid Pipes.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain (and meteors!) on any side. And set a waypoint with JourneyMap so you don't forget where you placed it!

Do not use these pipes in junctions or the items will choose which path to go at random and you don't want that.%n%n§3Keep in mind PR automation is laggy, so don't use it more than the minimum you can get away with on servers, wait until AE2 for that. In SP, do what you want, but keep in mind that AE2 is way more powerful.

# Quest.1624 - Junctions
gtnh.quest1624.name=Junctions
gtnh.quest1624.desc=So how do we deal with junctions then? We use these pipes. They are smart and they will send everything where it needs to go, so if you make a junction make sure you put this pipe there.

# Quest.1625 - Interacting With Stuff

They do not actively request for items, they only serve as a destination for items to go. You can open up the menu by rightclicking the chip. There you can set which items should it accept and the priority. Items will go to item responders with higher priority first.

# Quest.1628 - Item Overflow Chip
gtnh.quest1628.name=Item Overflow Chip
gtnh.quest1628.desc=This chip stores the items in a connected inventory. It designates a storage for items that have no other place to go. It is strongly recomended to have a default storage for items in every pipe system, otherwise bad stuff can happen. Best used with a large chest (diamond for example).%n%nIt seems to have some bugs though, so don't craft more than one without testing it first.%n%nYou might have to just use a normal item responder and add the items you want routed back to your overflow spot.

# Quest.1629 - Dynamic Item Responder
gtnh.quest1629.name=Dynamic Item Responder
gtnh.quest1629.desc=The dynamic item responder chip behaves exactly like an item responder chip, but instead of you setting up which items it should accept, it looks in the chest what items are there and those items it will accept.

# Quest.1630 - Item Extractor Chip
gtnh.quest1630.name=Item Extractor Chip
gtnh.quest1630.desc=This chip will extract items from the connecting inventory. The extracted items then look for pipes with item responder chips where there's a free space they could go. If they don't find any they will go to the overflow default storage chest.%n%nIf you want it to extract everything leave the filter empty and set it to blacklist.

# Quest.1631 - Item Broadcaster
gtnh.quest1631.name=Item Broadcaster
gtnh.quest1631.desc=The item broadcaster is a chip that tells everything in the pipe system what items it has in the connecting inventory and if another chip needs anything it will send it to them. Right click it to set the items it will transmit. If you leave it empty and set to blacklist it will transmit everything.%n%nDefinitely use one in combination with an item overflow chip on your default storage chest. That way overflow will end up in the chest, but will be useable by the rest of your system.

# Quest.1632 - Item Stock Keeper Chip
gtnh.quest1632.name=Item Stock Keeper Chip
gtnh.quest1632.desc=The item stock keeper looks at the connecting inventory and keeps item stocked in there. If the item is missing it will keep bothering item broadcasters every few seconds if they have the item and if they can send it. It's basically like an annoying child. %n%nIt is really useful though. Want a chest that will always have 64 cobble and dirt in it and if you take them they will get replaced? This guy is perfect for that job. It's great for keeping machines stocked. When stocking GT machines, the top left slot of the 3x3 is equal to the left slot of the machine. Want a chemical reactor that keeps 3 hydrogen cells ready to go to make ammonia, just add nitrogen? This is the chip for you.

# Quest.1633 - Crafting Chip
gtnh.quest1633.name=Crafting Chip
gtnh.quest1633.desc=The crafting chip does exactly what it says. It's not just for default crafting. You can use it with GT machines. Just put in the matrix that it should insert and the output is what it should extract. A great use for them is in combination with fluid canners or super tanks for filling cells. I would strongly recommend not overusing them. Wait untill you have access to AE2 for autocrafting stuff.

# Quest.1634 - Request Pipe
gtnh.quest1634.name=Request Pipe

If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.§r%n%nTime to build a simple system to store your stuff. Place down the drawer controller and place the drawers around it. Connect the interface pipe to the drawer controller and put the dynamic item responder and broadcaster chips inside. Don't forget to set the broadcaster to transmit everything by leaving the filter empty and setting it to blacklist. Now you can request stuff from your storage and if you have a chest with a pipe and extractor chip everything you put inside will be sorted into the storage.

gtnh.quest1638.desc=Now let's automate electrolyzing water into oxygen and hydrogen. You'll need hydrogen for tons of stuff including desulfurization, obtaining tungsten, and nitric acid production. Oxygen is also useful as I'm sure you noticed when making steel.%n%nHow to set it up:%n%nPlace the electrolyzer down and connect it to water and electricity. Place the 2 super tanks nearby. Set the electrolyzer to produce hydrogen gas and oxygen cells. Use normal GT fluid pipes to output the hydrogen gas into one super tank. That is now your hydrogen storage. Now connect interface pipes to all 3 machines.%n%nFor the electrolyzer put in item stock keeper set to keep 2 empty cells stored. Also put in extractor set to extract oxygen cells.%n%nNow for the oxygen storage put it item responder chip set to accept oxygen cells and extractor set to extract empty cells.%n%nNow put some empty cells inside your default storage chest and don't forget to have a broadcaster there.

# Quest.1639 - Desulfurizing the Oil
gtnh.quest1639.name=Desulfurizing the Oil
gtnh.quest1639.desc=Now it's time to start the actual desulfurization. Use a chemical reactor of your choice, fill it with sulfuric light fuel and hook it to power. Now connect an interface pipe to it. Put an item stock keeper inside set to store 4 hydrogen cells. Then put in item extractor set to extract hydrogen sulfide and empty cells.%n%nGo to your hydrogen storage super tank and put in a crafting chip set to make one hydrogen cell from one empty cell.%n%nAnd that's all.

# Quest.1640 - Dealing with H2S
gtnh.quest1640.name=Dealing with H2S
gtnh.quest1640.desc=Now let's convert all that H2S into sulfuric acid. Hook up a chemical reactor to electricity, water and interface pipe. Put inside an item responder chip set to accept H2S cells and extract empty cells. Distill that diluted sulfuric acid in distillery and store it in super tank.%n%nCongratulations. You now have a completely automatic desulfuring of oil, automatic production of hydrogen and oxygen and you also store all that sulfuric acid.

# Quest.1654 - §6§lAutomating Power On/Off
gtnh.quest1654.name=§6§lAutomating Power On/Off
gtnh.quest1654.desc=Once you have a GT boiler or Large Combusion Engine with a long startup time, you may wish to automate turning it on/off to save fuel, since extra power or Steam will just be voided. Additionally, the bigger your Steam/EU buffer is, the less time your generators will spend heating up, which makes them more efficient. Use a Machine Controller Cover on the controller (protip: You can put it on the top, bottom, or on the side next to a casing, casings will transmit redstone signal). §3You can use a Soldering Iron and Fine Soldering Alloy Wire to set the Redstone Output of a controller block to strong so it'll go through a casing (only casings, not hatches, busses, etc) to use with an activity detector if you want to receive a signal from the controller rather than turning it on/off with one.§r%n%nWith a Machine Controller Cover, you can use redstone to turn the machine on and off. This is handy if you don't want to use a Soft Hammer to disable a machine yourself constantly.%n %nThe best way to do that is with an RS latch. One input will turn the machine on, and one input will turn the machine off. Use a comparator attached to a valve to measure the steam level in your multiblock Iron or Steel Tank. Invert the signal to turn on your boiler when the steam level is low. When the steam level signal is high, turn your boiler off. Use a trail of redstone to lower the signal strength. Because of boiler/turbine warmup, try to set the ON strength to 30 percent of capacity and OFF strength to about 90 percent.%n%nRed alloy wire will hold a redstone signal for a longer distance than normal redstone, while redstone conduits will go indefinitely. You can also use amplified redcrystal to improve the strength of the signal for a long distance, repeating as necessary. %n%nYou can use a Energy Detector Cover in Normal Electrical Storage (including batteries) mode to monitor the power in a battery buffer and use it to enable/disable generators in a similar way. Change mode using a screwdriver. If you use a dense redcrystal, it will only allow signal through at a certain level, perfect for automating this kind of thing.%n%nYou can use MCCs on more than just generators though, you can use it on any multiblock (and most SBs too). This is useful to prevent voiding of materials. If a non-GT++ multi is full, it'll void the items or liquid (GT++ ones will halt) and keep on truckin', potentially voiding huge amounts of materials. You'll want to use them in combination with Fluid or Item Detection Covers on the output hatch or bus.%n%n§2If you still don't get it, watch moron's video on it at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPfnifJEO64

It takes two memory sticks, a BIOs rom, a CPU, and a hard drive at the very least to run your computer.%n%nThe power converter allows you to power it from your GregTech power grid, and the floppy drive will allow you to install your operating system onto the hard drive. Both parts are essential but both for some strange reason requires the T2 microchips to craft; so I'll let you trade the materials+T1 Microchips for some. Don't lose them!

# Quest.1755 - My Little Scrench

# Quest.1761 - Hello World!
gtnh.quest1761.name=Hello World!
gtnh.quest1761.desc=First things first, let's install OpenOS to the computer so you don't always need disk in the drive. Type in 'install' and then type 'Y' when asked if you wish to install OpenOS.     %n%nWhen finished, remove the disk and toss it on your wall and reboot the computer.%n%nType 'df' to display all present file systems and mount points, you'll notice one named OpenOS; this is your hard drive's default name after installing the OS.%n%nLet's change it with 'label -a OpenOS HDD', '-a' checks for names starting with what you type after it with that command. §3<-- part of this is apparently wrong? Thanks for the non-ticket explaining what part, guys.§r%n%nNow for fun, let's make your first program! How about something functional, make a with 'edit startup' this will bring you to an edit page for a new program called startup. Let's just have it do something simple, 'print("Hello World!")' Like that'll never get old.%n%nNow press Ctrl+S to save, and Ctrl+W to get out of that screen. Back in your home root let's now type startup and you'll see it display "Hello World!"  neat huh?%n%nLet's now make startup actually work on startup. Type 'edit .shrc' .shrc is a mystic file that runs shell commands when booting your PC. So in .shrc type 'startup' save and reboot the computer. Now it should say "Hello World!" upon starting. Double neat right?

# Quest.1762 - I Love Pressing the F5 Key.
gtnh.quest1762.name=I Love Pressing the F5 Key.
gtnh.quest1762.desc=It's so refreshing.%n%nPlace a keyboard facing a screen, or stuck to the back of a screen to make it able to interact with a computer.%n%nAbsolutely necessary to doing anything on your computer, but can safely be removed once you have an endlessly running program.

gtnh.quest1763.name=Mounting Your HDD
gtnh.quest1763.desc=Alright, you have your computer, it says "Hello World!" When you start it, and you feel awesome and capable of world domination. %n%nNow lets setup your HDD. Open .shrc again in the editor, and press ENTER to go down a line after the print, and type in 'cd ../' this will move your viewed directory that's being viewed to the absolute base directory.  %n%nNow go down another line and type in 'mount HDD C:' because why not, it's Classic; this mounts the file drive into the folder you're in. Go down another line and type cd 'C:/' save and reboot the computer.%n%nYou'll now start in C:/ nifty! Try typing 'mkdir programs' and now you have a dedicated directory to put your programs in for the sake of organization.%n'cd programs' will then take you to programs, and 'cd ../' will take you back a directory; you can also do things like, lets say you have a folder called apples in C as well but you're in apples, type 'cd ../apples' and it'll take you to apples. '..' essentially just means previous directory and this can be stacked; works with copying files and moving them as well, very useful to know.  %n%nBut right now we're going to do something functional, come over to the next quest and bring your adapter and cables.

# Quest.1764 - Basic Power Display
gtnh.quest1764.name=Basic Power Display
gtnh.quest1764.desc=For this part we will learn how to use our adapter, place it next to, let's say your EBFs battery buffer and connect it to the computer with cables.%nNow lets type in lua while on the computer to open the LUA environment where we can test things without worrying about saving and trying our program.%n%nType in 'component.list()' this will display a table of all of .list from component. What we're looking for is gt_batterybuffer.%nIf you have too many nearby things it may not display and the way to search the entire list of components is too advanced for starters.%n%nSo now assign a variable to it; for example 'a = component.gt_batterybuffer'; now we can call 'a' to see what methods the batteryBuffer has.%nWhat we'll be using in this example is the 'getBatteryCharge' method. So type  'a.getBatteryCharge(1)' this will call the method getBatteryCharge from the first inventory slot on the gt_batterybuffer in component.%n%nSo if we're using a 2x2 battery buffer; we can type something like, 'for i=1, 4 do print(a.getBatteryCharge(i)) end'%nPoof you now see what all the batteries EU values. Now what can we do with this?%n%nTry making a variable called 'batteryCharge = 0', now do 'for i=1, 4 do batteryCharge = batteryCharge + a.getBatteryCharge(i) end'%n%nNow print(batteryCharge) will display the total charge. Here's a program example of this being used.%n%nPlace in your tape drive and type 'install', and follow the promps to install it into C. Then edit it, test it, figure how it works.%n%nI suppose that's enough for now; congrats! Experiment and learn, and don't forget to check google as much as possible!  %nThis questline will be updated again in the future; but I figure this is a good ending point for now.

# Quest.1794 - Crop Stats
gtnh.quest1794.name=Crop Stats
gtnh.quest1794.desc=With the portable scanner, you can get the crop's stats and environmental info while it is still in the ground by right clicking it. It also stays scanned after getting the seed. Look for the portable scanner quest after the EBF in Multiblock Goals. About those stats:%n%n§aGrowth§r:%nHow fast it grows, with higher = faster. Specifically, it increases the growth points your crop gets per growth tick. If it gets to 24+, your crop acts like a weed, so most people say to stay at 23 or less. However, it will only weed other crops under certain conditions.%n%n1) Is in a cardinal direction on the same Y level. 2) Will only affect dirt/grass, or cropsticks or crops 3) If there's a crop there that is §oalso§r a weed, if it's at a maturity level > 1, it §owon't affect it§r 4) If it affects the crop, it'll be replaced with a normal weed%n%n§9Gain§r:%nInfluences chances of how many drops you get, and whether you get any at all. 31 is the best for sure.%n%n§eResistance§r:%nThis stat is responsible for a couple of crops' properties: chances for getting a seed while punching crop, resistance of your crop to trampling (jumping on it), decreases chance of crop dying due to lack of enviromental stats, and resistance of crop to weed spread. It also reduces mutation chance as it goes up (apparently). Aim for around 10 for balance.

# Quest.1795 - Metals From the Sky
gtnh.quest1795.name=Metals From the Sky
gtnh.quest1795.desc=You can even create metals not found on Earth using crops! You'll need the proper metal block beneath the crop in order for them to fully mature.%n%nBTW, higher tier crops have a lower chance of dropping seeds, so consider breeding a second one before you try breaking them, ok?

gtnh.quest1812.name=§9§lTeflon Don
gtnh.quest1812.desc=To make PTFE, aka Teflon, you only need a few steps.  %n%nThe first one is hydrofluoric acid. If you haven't reached the moon yet, the best sources for fluorine might be cryolite. Other options are mining calcite or sandstone for a chance at fluorite ore, and centrifuging stone dust or black granite dust for biotite. You can also get small amounts from Lepidolite in salt veins and Mica. Mix it with some hydrogen to get hydrofluoric acid.%n%nIf you have reached the moon, you can also process Bastnasite ore.

# Quest.1813 - §9§lChloroform
gtnh.quest1813.name=§9§lChloroform
gtnh.quest1813.desc=The next step is to mix methane and chlorine to make chloroform. Make sure you have your circuit set correctly.%n%nNow is probably a good time to look at stockpiling chlorine. Look for salt ores, or lapis veins. You can also make salt water with ghast tears. Better get started with IC2 crops, you'll need a lot of chlorine later!

# Quest.1814 - §9§lPolytetrafluoroethylene
gtnh.quest1814.name=§9§lPolytetrafluoroethylene
gtnh.quest1814.desc=Molten plastics smell great, don't they? Mix your hydrofluoric acid and chloroform to make tetrafluoroethylene. React the TFE with oxygen to make molten PTFE.

gtnh.quest1853.desc=Welcome to the latest Moron's Manual, Effective EBFing! This manual covers common problems encountered when using the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace.%n%nSetup%nWhen setting up your EBF, make sure to place it a few chunks away from things pollution affects, like farmland. Pollution is nobody's friend!%n%nDuring setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow. Sometimes things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light orb!%n%nMake sure your muffler faces §lout§r, not §lin§r. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!%n%nWhen placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF. Especially at LV, those few blocks make a big difference! Every amp of energy travelling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to get longer running time until you get stable power.%n%nOutput hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them such as chests or BC tanks. They will also void if they're full, so keep an eye on them!%n%nWhen building multiple EBFs, the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share walls. This can save you on input and output hatches too. Not recommended for energy and maintenance hatches!

# Quest.1869 - §6§lThe Church of Benzene's Holy Altar
gtnh.quest1869.name=§6§lThe Church of Benzene's Holy Altar
gtnh.quest1869.desc=The MV Gas Turbine pairs excellently with Benzene, now that you can actually make it. Look at the "Bio for the Masses" tab for more details on how to go about it, or just check NEI. Benzene is renewable from trees, and it's a powerful source of EU that can keep you going for several tiers as long as you upgrade it with the new multiblocks you unlock over time.%n%nIt's a good idea to switch off Steam, since you need big pipes to carry that around and the fuel efficiency on Steam Turbines is lower. Instead, make a Pyrolyse Oven or an Advanced Coke Oven to make Charcoal faster, extract Benzene from it and run it through a few of these Gas Turbines.

# Quest.1870 - §6§lDiesel Power
gtnh.quest1870.name=§6§lDiesel Power
gtnh.quest1870.desc=The MV Combustion Generator burns Light Fuel faster than the LV version, but you can also automate Diesel and burn that instead, since it's even more powerful. It is arguably the easiest and most efficient way to generate lots of power for automation at this stage, and it'll last you a couple more tiers if you upgrade it as you go.%n%nAdditionally, Diesel can be used as fuel for the Copterpack, a good jetpack that makes it much easier to move around, inside and outside of your base. It's heavily recommended that you make one, if you have Diesel.%n%n§3This will also unlock new quests in the Armors and Jetpacks tab.

# Quest.1871 - §9§lLV Field Generator
gtnh.quest1871.name=§9§lLV Field Generator

You'll need to figure out a way to stop that.

# Quest.1876 - §a§9§lAmplifying Your UUM Production
gtnh.quest1876.name=§a§9§lAmplifying Your UUM Production
gtnh.quest1876.desc=To get UUAmplifier out of your scrap you need an Amplifabricator. Both types of scrap are equivalent.

# Quest.1877 - §9§lUUMatter
gtnh.quest1877.name=§9§lUUMatter
gtnh.quest1877.desc=Now you can actually make the UUM with a Mass Fabricator. Well, technically you could make it without UUA, but that's way more expensive. To make sure it only runs with UUA, put a programmed circuit (any value) in the machine's slot. UUMatter can be used for some very specific things, such as replicating §osome§r materials (check NEI, mostly/all periodic table), used with crops or bee combs to create an ore, some specific high-level recipes need it, and...you can also sit in it to get regen.%n%nThe way the device works is both simple and yet complicated. I'll explain. It gets a better than perfect OC of 2/2 rather than the normal 4/2 or a perfect 4/4. I have prepared a chart to explain:%n%nTier  Amps    Total Power   Time%nLV    8A LV       256         160%nMV    4A MV       512           80%nHV    2A HV     1024           40%nEV    1A EV     2048           20%nIV    0.5A IV    4096           10%netc.%n%nSo basically, since it gets better every tier, you want to build the most advanced one you can if you want better UUM production. Of course, it's more expensive. Put in power (and hopefully UUA), and out comes UUM.

# Quest.1893 - §6§lFluid Regulator
gtnh.quest1893.name=§6§lFluid Regulator
gtnh.quest1893.desc=Turbines require precise amounts of fluids or else they will §4explode§r. Use the fluid regulator on the pipe attached to the input bus to control the rate of fluids into the turbine. To raise the fluid limit, look at the right side of the regulator and:%n%n1L - Right click with an empty hand%n16L - Right click with a screwdriver%n256L - Right click with a screwdriver while sneaking%n%nTo lower the fluid limit, do the same while looking at the left side.%n%nUse the Large Turbine Calculator and the Turbine stats sheet on the spreadsheet to find what to set it to (after deciding on a fuel).

# Quest.1894 - §6§lGas Turbine
gtnh.quest1894.name=§6§lGas Turbine
gtnh.quest1894.desc=A Large Gas Turbine is more fuel-efficient than singleblock turbines, and can have lower pollution output with upgraded mufflers.%n%nYou will also need a Muffler and Dynamo Hatch to complete the multiblock. Don't forget to use a Fluid Regulator, to control the flow rate into the multi! It can usually be an LV Fluid Regulator, since the optimal flow is much lower here than in Steam Turbines.%n%nEach turbine material has a specific fuel efficiency (the higher, the more EU you get from the same amount of fuel), and the multi only reaches this efficiency if the fuel flow into it matches the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 150% of optimal flow to produce 112% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 300% of optimal flow to produce 180% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 450% of optimal flow to produce 252% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.%n%nFor the best turbine materials, see the spreadsheet and Large Turbine Calculator.%n%n§4Going forward, the LGT will be capped at 8192 EU/t. You will need to use the advanced large gas turbine beyond that which can only take high value fuels.%n%n%n%n

# Quest.1899 - §a§lDouble the Fun
gtnh.quest1899.name=§a§lDouble the Fun
gtnh.quest1899.desc=Need even more power? Why not combine rods? Produces more power (NOT double, it varies per rod type) and more heat (again NOT double) but only uses up one slot. You need more complex designs to handle them, but you were ready for that, right?%n%nSo how about doubling your doubling to double your double (4x)? Quad rods put out even more power and heat, expect all the other rods to work similarly (for the most part).%n%n§3BTW it's more efficient to go 1->4 rather than 1->2->4 materials-wise.

gtnh.quest1902.desc=With a nuke, you can cause some real catastrophic damage to your base. You can either place it 20 chunks away, or surround it with blast proof materials.%n%nFused Quartz is no good now, forget about it ok? Instead, use the GTNH approved Plated Reinforced Stone series! Or one of the other options I guess, like Warded Glass. You may need multiple layers depending on your reactor, try it out in creative. Remember you must close in the corners - blasts can slip through the cracks. To get power out, do right angle turns on the wires as blasts go in a straight line.%n%n§3There are 6 of them, use NEI.%n%nOkay, okay, you don't have to forget Fused Quartz, I'll give you some.

# Quest.1905 - §6§lLarge Heat Exchanger - Fermat's Last
gtnh.quest1905.name=§6§lLarge Heat Exchanger - Fermat's Last
gtnh.quest1905.desc=The Large Heat Exchanger is a powergen multi that accepts a non-direct fuel, and doesn't output EU. What is it for, then? §7§7§7To heat up water with hot liquids, that's what!§r§r§r%n%nEffectively, it's a Steam Boiler that uses fluids instead of solids, but it's more complicated. The two main sources of energy here are Lava and Hot Coolant, and the second is more powerful, but harder to get. Lava can be automated from Everburn Urns or a myriad of other option, while Hot Coolant usually requires a proper powergen setup.%n%nFor Lava, the LHE will output §d§d§d160 L of Steam for every 1 L of Lava, up to 1000 L/s of Lava input§r§r§r (§a§a§a4000 EU/t§r§r§r at 100% turbine efficiency).

gtnh.quest1916.name=§6§lWhere's That Handyman When You Need Him?
gtnh.quest1916.desc=A Needs Maintenance cover will send out a redstone signal when the controller it's attached to requires maintenance. This is handy for the cleanroom you'll need to build in HV, since maintenance issues reduces cleanliness level and will cause voided materials.%n%nFor the cleanroom you can place this on the top or bottom. For other machines you might want to place it on the side so you can have access to the front face. In that case, you can use a soldering iron and fine solder to have it emit a strong redstone signal that will penetrate through a block next to the cover.

gtnh.quest1989.desc=The core block of Stacy's...er Steve's Factory Manager. SFM is a high tier automation system. While AE2 can handle simple crafting up to 9 components at a time and even nesting ingredients, SFM can handle the complex crafting required for the assline.%n%nInventory Cables connect the MIM to inventories or tanks.%n%nRight now until some Moron figures it out, your best bet is to experiment, ask for help on Discord, and search Google. The interface resembles most GUI based automation systems like LabView.%n%nThere have been TPS problems caused by poorly designed SFM setups. Make sure your outputs are properly emptied, and don't get filled.%n%nInventory cables are the "basic" cable of SFM. They allow the MIM to interact with an inventory, and act as a connector cable to other cables.%n%nmehdi2344 thinks my jokes suck, but he's an idiot, so there. %n%nThanks to Nori Silverrage for writing up these quests!%n%n§3BTW, there's a Creative Supplier for creative testing.

# Quest.2007 - Quantum Computer
gtnh.quest2007.name=Quantum Computer
gtnh.quest2007.desc=One of the most incredibly complicated machines, this will serve as the main structure for your Computation generation for the Research Station. %n%nFirst, you'll need a few things: the Quantum Computer itself, The Uncertainty Resolver, some good circuits and the Computer Racks to hold them, and at least a UV energy hatch (maybe start with a UV 4A energy hatch). The QC will consume 1A of UV, and each rack will use one more. So another important factor is to ONLY turn on the Quantum Computer once you have the desired recipe for the Research Station ready to avoid excess energy loss. Remember to turn the QC on BEFORE the RS. In order for you to build this absolute monster, you'll need to place down the Quantum Computer at least 1 block above the surface/ground and use the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector to see where to place everything. The blocks with no dots next to the vents indicate that that space must be empty. Later you'll want to build a bigger QC. Use a stack of multiple Hologram Projectors to see how that is build. If at some point even a maximum size QC with 24 racks is no longer sufficient, you can also chain multiple QCs. For now, let us focus on a basic setup.%n%nUncertainty Resolver:%nA mini-game that might take you a bit to understand. Your goal is to balance the lights around the focal points. Sometimes, the Schrödinger Status will require some puzzle solving again after a period of time. This is random and incredibly frustrating, especially during operations being done between the Research Station and Quantum Computer(s), so it is important to constantly check the Uncertainty Resolver before you start operations on your Computer. If the puzzle looks too hard or you can't complete it, just remove it and the controller and re-place them to get a different puzzle.%n%nComputer Racks:%nThe main component within the multiblock to generate Computation. In order to achieve this, you will need to input some circuits and ic2 heat vents; Advanced Heat Vents work best. It is critical that you use Heat Vents to prevent the heat from reaching a catastrophic point. Computer Racks will always melt or explode about 9000 heat (also written as 90 percent, 10000 being 100 percent) but most circuits have much lower thresholds. For our example here we will use Ultimate Crystalcomputers. With these, any heat above 54 percent should be avoided for safety reasons! The maximum heat will be different for different circuits, even if they are of the same tier. You can see the heat for individual racks by scanning them. You cannot remove or insert components until the heat is gone. You can see the overall heat value in the controller's interface. And most importantly: DO NOT WRENCH THE COMPUTER RACKS IF THEY HAVE HEAT IN THEM. Otherwise, you're going to get an explosion.%n%nComputation:%nComputation is generated every second and is based on the tier of your circuit. There are, however, differences in between how much computation is generated, even with the same exact tier. For instance, you could use a Master Quantum Computer (Quantum Circuit Series / LuV) or a Wetwareprocessor (Wetware Circuit Series / LuV) which will give you more Computation even though they are of the same tier. If you wish to find out exactly how much Computation a circuit gives; place down a Computer Rack, put a circuit inside and scan it. You can also see the total computation in the controller.%n%nIt will include the following information.%nBase computation: %nAfter overclocking: <same as above unless you specially overclock it>%nHeat Accumulated: <based on circuits and heat vents, keep a watchful eye on this part as it's extremely important>%n%nYou can find an overview of circuits with their maximum heat and Computation generation on the GTNH wiki.%n%nUsing the Parametrizer you can overclock and overvolt the QC, but we won't do so for our example setup here.%n%nSending Computation to the Research Station:%nUse the Optical Master Connector in one of the variable spaces on the QC, and the Optical Slave Connector on the RS. Use Optical Fiber Cable to connect them, and make sure to paint all three.%n%nExample setup:%nNow that you've understood the concepts and safety of handling of the QC, what are the more optimal setups for your Quantum Computer? For now, we suggest 2 racks with 3 Ultimate Crystalcomputers each, and of course 1 Advanced Heat Vent. This gives you 156 C/s and will get you started with recipes in the Research Station. This is a rather minimal setup though, you should probably think about more optimized (or just larger) setups later!%n%nNow that you understand the QC, it's time to build it! You'll need to gather quite a lot of resources.

# Quest.2008 - Research Station
gtnh.quest2008.name=Research Station
gtnh.quest2008.desc=Now that you've started building up your precious Quantum Computer, how about the Research Station? Once again, using the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector will tell you how to build this Multiblock. There should be 3 empty blocks beneath it so you can see the whole blueprint. Once it is nearly assembled, place down an Energy Hatch, an Optical Slave Connector, and a Maintenance Hatch all on the back side.%n%nOnce fully assembled, you can begin operating recipes at any time, so long as the Quantum Computer is also active and connected. The Research Station requires you to put the item to research within the Object Holder, then a data stick in the Multiblock interface. Once the Computation is fully completed, the data stick that houses all the data of the completed item will be inside the Multiblock Interface.%n%nStill confused? Good, that's the spirit of learning! Always make sure to test these things in creative single player if you wish to find exact measurements and such. Don't forget to ALWAYS COLOR THE OPTICAL HATCHES AND FIBERS!%n%n§3Note that some researches require a significant amount of amps, so keep that in mind.§r

# Quest.2110 - §6§lSpeeding Up Slow Machines
gtnh.quest2110.name=§6§lSpeeding Up Slow Machines
gtnh.quest2110.desc=Many mods don't have methods of speeding up their slow machines. For this, you'll need a GregTech World Accelerator. It guzzles amps though, so your power infrastructure better be ready for it. The tooltip will list the performance boost provided. For block-based acceleration, the WA will do an area around it. For TileEntities like most machines, it will only accelerate the blocks directly touching the WA, and will need to be reconfigured with a screwdriver. This uses twice the power though.%n%n§4This does not work with GregTech machines!§r For those, build more or higher tier ones.%n%nIf you want, you can change the level of acceleration by using a wrench on it. It will go back to the minimum, then increase one tier from there for every usage.

gtnh.quest2141.name=§6§lWelcome to the Church of Benzene
gtnh.quest2141.desc=If you made it to MV using steam, you're probably wondering how to survive going further. One option is to switch to Light Fuel, discussed in LV. Another option is to use Benzene. Benzene is made from Wood Tar. There are a couple of pathways for that. Both start with logs from trees.  %n%nOne path is to use Coke Ovens or Advanced Coke Ovens to make charcoal, and fluid-extract Wood Tar from it (use LV fluid extractors for maximum EU efficiency). Then distill the Wood Tar to make Benzene. This method produces less pollution, but will also provide less Benzene.%n%nThe second path is to use the Pyrolyze Oven multiblock and Nitrogen gas to extract Wood Tar and Charcoal. Fluid Extract the Charcoal for addtional Wood Tar. Then proceed as above. This method will create pollution from the Pyrolyze, but will provide more Benzene per log.%n%nExcess wood tar can also be turned into Toluene, a key ingredient for explosives that you'll need later on to make rockets.%n%nIf you use the Charcoal Byproducts recipe, you can get a plethora of useful byproducts as well, but you'll need 4 DTs.

gtnh.quest2143.desc=Need a map on fuel choices? Well, we don't have that but we have suggestions. You can use Steam up to IV, but beyond MV it gets pretty painful. %n%nIn LV you can start refining oil for either Light Fuel for a Combustion Generator or Refinery Gas for a Gas Turbine. %n%nOnce you hit MV you can switch from Steam to renewable Benzene (Gas) from your logs. Other renewable alternatives are Fish Oil or Seed Oil based bio diesel (combustion). Seed Oil can be sourced from Pam's peanuts, IC2 Rape crop or Forestry tree nuts.%n%nAt MV you can also upgrade your Light Fuel with Heavy Fuel to get Diesel. When you reach HV turn diesel or bio diesel into Cetane Boosted Diesel. In EV, you can make HOG, but it's complex, and you'll need to rejigger your whole oil distillation setup, since it uses different fluids than Cetane does.%n%nEV introduces the Large Gas Turbine, Large Steam Turbine, Large HP Steam Turbine, and Large Combustion Engine, which are more efficient versions of the earlier ones. The first 3 require turbines. %n%nYou can also make Nukes, or Wind and Water Kinetics.%n%nFor low-power operations, or dedicated players willing to setup autocrafting, you can begin using Solar Panels at MV.

# Quest.2150 - §a§lOne BILLION EU
gtnh.quest2150.name=§a§lOne BILLION EU
gtnh.quest2150.desc=If you want a stationary battery, you can make an AFSU capable of storing up to 1 billion EU and charging items. You can pick it up with a wrench, but you'll lose a percentage of the stored EU. Make sure you right-click, not left-click. Left-clicking will cause it to lose all stored EU.%n%nAs an alternative, if you can afford them, try the GT++ Energy Buffers. They are more expensive and cannot charge items, but store more, don't lose any EU, and can be configured from 1-16A. See the GT++ tab for details.%n%n§3These can apparently draw infinite amps, so maybe use a diode or something if you like having the power on.

# Quest.2160 - Carpenter's Blocks
gtnh.quest2160.name=Carpenter's Blocks
gtnh.quest2160.desc=Yet another custom block system! Carpenter's blocks are crafted blank and placed in-world, and then plain block textures applied to them. The blocks must not be Tile Entities, so Botany blocks don't work correctly with them, but GT Stones like Red Granite, and any colored clay or vanilla glass block will work. Some Chisel glass types will work, and Ztones blocks and Tinted Glass also work.%n%nThe Garage Door requires a block at the top to hang "down" from, but can pretty much be any length.  A redstone signal on any block next to the Garage Door blocks will open or close the door. The open/close will propagate across multiple vertical doors, so you can setup non-square doors. Sneaking and right-clicking with an empty hand will change the door's polarity.%n%nThe pressure plates are player-only activation, making them great for doors into your base.%n%nThe hatches must be clicked on the side of a block to place. They can be handy for protecting you from crucible...byproducts.%n %nThere is a lot more block shapes possible, check NEI for "Carpenter's" to see the options.%n%nThe Chisel allows you to chisel blocks while attached to a Carpenter's block.%n%nThe Hammer allows various functions.%n%nHammer on door - changes door shape type%nSneak Hammer on door - Changes from iron to wooden behavior%nSneak Hammer on lever - Changes polarity (which direction is on/off)

# Quest.2161 - §3§lSafety First
gtnh.quest2161.name=§3§lSafety First
gtnh.quest2161.desc=For those new to GregTech, here are some tips and warnings about electricity. %n%nMachines don't like being out in the rain, and will start fires nearby. Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier cause an explosion. Or several, if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.%n%nSending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a wire does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.%n%nA generator that supplys 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than full voltage.  For example, macerators doing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run several off of a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. Why? Because there's loss for every amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are batter than wires. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.%n%nMost machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier) + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding cables.%n%nSome machines are specifically for dealing with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers, and diodes.%n%nIf you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV and LV has thier own lossless cables). You can use the laser hatches much later to send even more.%n%nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.%n%nNote that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ tier. So 2 EU at LV, 4 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of your power, and even 1 can prevent usage of an EBF at MV voltage. Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes less of something to worry about.%n%nIf this info isn't enough for you, head on over to https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Electricity to read more.

# Quest.2209 - Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees
gtnh.quest2209.name=Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees
gtnh.quest2209.desc=First off, don't be scared by the massive amounts of bees you see here once you unlock the breeding trees. There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!%n%nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! Once you unlock the bee breeding lines, look around and pick and choose which bees really interest you. The way the breeding is done is mostly left to right, and top down. Some of the lines at the bottom might look simple, but they will require bees further up to complete first. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown here.%n%nBees have two sets of traits, one that is §aActive§r that has effects on how the bee lives, and one §3Inactive§r but can be used for breeding. Some traits are §4Dominant§r, and some are §9Recessive§r. Keep this in mind when trying to breed in or out a new trait. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the targeted bee traits. You can breed the bees with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. You can't see the passive traits using a Field Kit, you'll need a Beealyzer. For lots of bees, you can scan them first using a GT scanner, but you'll still need a Beealyzer to see passive traits.%n%nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee.  A bee that has little or no crossbreeding potential, but has all the traits you prefer - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, etc.  Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.%n%nWhen you are trying for a new bee, what you are wanting is a drone - this way you can use your "breeding stock" princess for easy breeding, but the drone to get the new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poor crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good for this, since they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let them live longer. Once you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die (they can become ignoble under certain circumstances though, like using tons of production frames). Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits already, and there's a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect them with that.%n%nOnce you get a new species, it will replace all of one of the two sets of traits of the bee. §3If you get the mutation chance success twice on the same bee, it'll replace both active and inactive sets of traits though.§r For example when you get a Cultivated, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated! All the quests will require §6purebred§r species. PS: most effects are useless, so don't worry too much.%n%nAll traits can be bred into any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species also determines the preferred temperature and humidity, as well as drops. Species will require their preferred temerature and humidity to be in 'jubilant' state, and produce their special drops. You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT with tolerances.%n%nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances, or to lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for that pristine princess to become ignoble!%n%nIt looks complex, because it is! But it's also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!

# Quest.2210 - §a§lDealing with Radiation
gtnh.quest2210.name=§a§lDealing with Radiation
gtnh.quest2210.desc=Nuclear materials cause two types of radiation effects. One is a large number of standard debuffs. These can be removed the normal ways, with milk or terra wart or other methods that imitate them. %n%nThe other effect is a special Radiation unique debuff. This gets applied the longer you hold onto the radioactive item. Severely radioactive items can apply minutes of this deadly debuff. Regeneration might delay the inevitable death, but most regeneration sources aren't fast enough or long enough to keep you alive. You can try using an Amulet of Remedium to get rid of the effects. You should have one from your Moon trip, if not you'll have to dive into Thaumcraft to make one.

# Quest.2211 - Basic Bee Stats
gtnh.quest2211.name=Basic Bee Stats
gtnh.quest2211.desc=There are a couple of basic bees that have good stats you will want to breed into your breeding stock.%n%nCave Dwelling - Rocky - This lets you put the bee housing underneath or inside. Handy for putting a chest on top for products.%n%nNocturnal - Rocky - This keeps your bees working all night long, and in the dark.%n%nRain Tolerant - Water - Keep producing even when it is raining.%n%nHigh Fertility - Wintry - For breeding purposes, you want the maximum number of drones produced.%n%nReminder - Specialty products from bees require Jubilant state.

Well that's In-Game Info, a handy mod that gives you necessary information for GregTech: New Horizons.%n%nThe most important info is whether or not you are in an ore chunk. Later quests will explain what that means.%n%nIf you don't want to see the IGI information, you can use %n%n§l/igi disable%n/igi enable%n§r%nto disable and enable the window.%n%n§l/igi config%n%n§rwill bring up the configuration window, which you can use to control placement, and the scale/size of the font.%n%n%nAnother useful display is Extra Utilities' TPS meter. It gives you the instantaneous tps, average tps, and worst-case tps. TPS is Ticks-per-second, a measure of how well your server is running. TPS=20 is ideal, and TPS<15 is going to start noticeably lagging. TPS<10 is going to be hard to play. If you need suggestions solving TPS problems, contact us on Discord.%n%nToggle the display with%n%n§l/xu_tps

# Quest.2407 - §3§lWhat Engineer Doesn't Want a Portable Workbench?
gtnh.quest2407.name=§3§lWhat Engineer Doesn't Want a Portable Workbench?
gtnh.quest2407.desc=This backpack sacrifices some space to give you a portable crafting table. You have to put the items you want to craft inside the backpack. Because of this, you can use it to quickly craft large amounts of items at once. %n%nYou can also use the Forestry Worktable with its larger inventory to do the same. Once you reach MV, you can switch to an Adventure Backpack that includes a pair of tanks for storing fluids if you want.

# Quest.2408 - §9§lControlling Your Drawers
gtnh.quest2408.name=§9§lControlling Your Drawers
gtnh.quest2408.desc=Now that you have MV Circuits and Stainless Steel, you can make the incredibly handy Drawer Controller. This block will make any drawers it connects to in a 4-block radius (including the y-axis) and 50 blocks at maximum as part of a multiblock that allows storage (and retrieval with the right setup) to any of the blocks that make it up. This will allow you to dump the contents of your mining trip into a storage system much easier. Just hold right click on the Controller front for a second or two, and any items that match what's already in the multiblock will be deposited, while your tools and such won't. Just make sure to place your Controller last so it registers all the drawers.%n%nYou can feed into the Controller (and thus the rest of the drawers) with any kind of piping or hopper equivalent. If using it as part of a Multifarm or Mob Farm, make sure to set the contents of the drawers, and lock them with a key so that it properly stores everything in an organized manner. If the drawers' contents aren't set, it will start filling starting from the ones closest. If you wish to have more than one drawer full of an item, put a void upgrade on the drawer further from the Controller, and it will fill the first one, then the second.%n%nIf you want to go around corners, use the Trim Drawers to extend the multiblock. If you want to have a second point to dump items into, use the Controller Slave (one per multiblock, automation only). Note that you can use a key on the Controller to affect all drawers at once.%n%nOnce you have an ME Network, place a storage bus on the Controller, and the entire inventory will be accessible from the network, with both storage and retrieval. Just remember to set the priority higher than your ME Drives. If you haven't locked them yet expect all your drawers to fill with random items from your ME Network.%n%n§4Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will tank TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.%n%nAdditionally, expect all non-backpack interactions to be DISABLED on the official servers. Congratulations, Drawer Cubists, you ruined it for everyone.

# Quest.2409 - §6§lEven Rarer Earths
gtnh.quest2409.name=§6§lEven Rarer Earths
gtnh.quest2409.desc=Rare Earth processing may have been ignored, but you believe your new Dehydrator can finally make it worthwhile. First, you need to use some Sulfuric Acid to melt off any impurities in a Chemical Bath, leaving you with Crushed Rare Earth (I). After that you need to process it like a normal ore until you get Rare Earth (I) Dust.%n%nAfter running the Dust through your Dehydrator, you get a number of strange materials, only some of which you recognize. But if you run these materials through an Electrolyzer or through the Dehydrator again, you may get some use out of them. Some of them may take quite a few to do so, but you §o§o§r§h§ohave§r been stockpiling, right? You'll need 204 Rare Earth.%n%nYou believe if you had more powerful acids and machines, you could extract even more valuable materials out of the Rare Earth.

# Quest.2410 - Journey to the Center of the Earth
gtnh.quest2410.name=Journey to the Center of the Earth
gtnh.quest2410.desc=After acquiring your new pickaxe and clearing away a mountain or two, you wonder if maybe you should go...§odeeper§r. After trying it out on some Bedrock, you see a way down into the very depths of the planet. After exploring this new realm you make a note that it is:%n%nA) Seemingly empty of life%nB) Full of Bedrock you need to clear away with your new pickaxe%nC) Full of ore veins going up and down%nD) Some of these ores are strange and §odifferent§ §r from the ones you are used to%nE) Since Miners cannot break Bedrock, if you wish to use one, you'll have to do it for it first.%nF) After leaving you wake up on the surface somewhere nearby, your lack of memories of such is probably due to Oxygen deprivation. §oProbably§r. (After leaving the Bedrock Dim, you'll be thrown out somewhere nearby on what is hopefully the surface, and not inside a block, but no guarantees!)%n%nAmong the ore samples you seem to have brought back with you, you find a number of "basic" and "intermediate" ores and gems, as well as a few you don't recognize! Perhaps a return trip is in order?  %n%nAlso, you seem to smell like cheese for some reason?

# Quest.2411 - Fool's Gold
gtnh.quest2411.name=Fool's Gold
gtnh.quest2411.desc=After holding a Primal Charm for a while, you suddenly understand some of it's whispers! It tells of a land filled with untold riches, just waiting for someone to claim them. You scoff at the claim, but apparently if you "Open the Eye" and create a very fancy carved stone, you can create a portal there. But this eye it speaks of...just what is it? Maybe by delving into the darker realm of magic...bah! Only fools would believe such nonsense.

# Quest.2412 - Gen XXXXXXXXXX...
gtnh.quest2412.name=Gen XXXXXXXXXX...
gtnh.quest2412.desc=Yes! Yes! The eyes! You understand now, it is all too clear! The land of riches, it is yours! But what is this? It's empty? Why, where have your Riches gone? The sole inhabitant tells you that all such things have faded away long ago, with the End of Time at hand...But that simply means you're in the right PLACE after all! You're simply in the wrong TIME. If you simply adjust the portal a little, you can arrive at the right PLACE and TIME to get your well-deserved Riches. You suspect that such an adjustment would require something strong...INFINITELY strong.%n%nIn the meantime you now have a very very big closet to store your things in once the old owner...moves out. Upon leaving, you spot a tiny Ghast, surely just your imagination? Unfortunately the shifting of time causes you to end up in what is likely wilderness when you leave. (Exiting through the portal sends you back to the world spawn)%n%nIn order to build a machine to take you to both the right place and time, you're going to have to roll up your sleeves and get to the very limits of technological prowess you can imagine. (see the Endgame Goals tab when you're ready)

# Quest.2413 - The Darkness of Choice for Edgelords
gtnh.quest2413.name=The Darkness of Choice for Edgelords
gtnh.quest2413.desc=In order to get to the riches you rightfully deserve, you'll first need to make a Raw Portal, then complete it with more materials. You can then access this dimension that should contain every ore imaginable...%n%n§3Unfortunately, those tasty ores are locked beneath the mantle of the planet. You'll need to use a Void Miner to get them out.

# Quest.2414 - §6§lToo Many Items? Unpossible!
gtnh.quest2414.name=§6§lToo Many Items? Unpossible!
gtnh.quest2414.desc=Too many items getting you down? Just slap this badboy on a drawer, and any items you put in over the maximum will be automatically voided for you! More useful in combination with a Drawer Controller admittedly.

# Quest.2415 - Bringing the Biome to You
gtnh.quest2415.name=Bringing the Biome to You
gtnh.quest2415.desc=So maybe you can't find a swamp or tropical forest for your crops or bees, or maybe they're too far away so they're inconvenient to get to, or maybe your base is in a colder climate and you have to deal with the howls of direwolves constantly. Instead of packing up all your stuff and moving somewhere else, why not try changing the biome? There are a couple different ways to do so in this modpack:%n%nUse the Arcane Terrestrial Reformer from Witching Gadgets%n-Requires EV Circuits, Tungstensteel, Rocket Tier III%n-Also requires Infusion, Void Metal (sufficient warp), Energized Node for CV, lots of Essentia%n-16 block radius%n-Can only change to a few specific Vanilla or Thaumcraft biomes%n-Kind of slow%n%nUse Ritual of Gaia's Transformation from Blood Magic%n-Requires Void Metal, Infusion, Tungstensteel%n-Requires getting deep into BM (and the warp that come with it)%n-Requires 1,000,000 LP, Master Blood Orb, Tier 4 Altar and Awakened Activation Crystal%n-10 block radius, can be exactly specified with bloodstone bricks (either type)%n-Cannot specify which biome you get, you can only change the temperature/humidity within the 0.0 - 2.0 range and hope%n-Some biomes may be impossible due to limited range and overlap%n-Adjust temperature/humidity with items on 8 plinths around the Master Ritual Stone%n-Need to relog to see changes%n-Very little documentation or explanation%n-Fast%n%nUse the Brew of Shifting Seasons from Witchery%n-Small range, depends on the level of the brew (power, not dispersal extent)%n-Biome can be exactly specified%n-Crafted using the complicated custom brew system%n-Can add different ingredients to change range of the brew%n-At min changes a single block%n-At max has about a 3 block (circular) radius%n-Instant (once you use it)%n%nUse the Rite of Shifting Seasons from Witchery%n-Requires Stainless Steel, Greatwood Scepter or better for the Distillery%n-You have to do a bunch of witchery stuff%n-Not hard once you're done it once%n-Extremely large range, 16/32/48 block (circular) radius%n-Biome can be exactly specified%n-Sometimes fails in specific chunks%n-Very Fast%n%nIf you want to know how to use the Witchery methods, please go to the Look to the edges tab to continue.%n%nPSA: The IC2&Galacticraft Terraformers only change the surface, not the biome itself.

# Quest.2416 - Ghetto Biome Changing
gtnh.quest2416.name=Ghetto Biome Changing
gtnh.quest2416.desc=If you don't want to change the biome to a specific one, and just want a neutral environment for your bees, maybe using nodes is for you. You can try planting a Silverwood Sapling to get one with a pure node, or use other methods to move one.%n%nKeep in mind a 'bare' pure node won't change anything unless it has Victus. You can try use Sinister or Tainted, but...no refunds. These nodes have a radius of 11. To change the biome back, use an Ethereal Bloom (radius of 7). Keep in mind that both Pech and Wisps spawn in 'Magical' type biomes.

# Quest.2417 - Changing Biomes With Witchery
gtnh.quest2417.name=Changing Biomes With Witchery
gtnh.quest2417.desc=There are two ways to change biomes with Witchery, the easy way or the hard way, choose which one you want to do (or do them both). Remember that you need a Witchery Distillery first!

# Quest.2418 - The Easy Way to Change Biomes
gtnh.quest2418.name=The Easy Way to Change Biomes
gtnh.quest2418.desc=So you want the easy way? Ok, go get this stuff:%nMandrake Root, Nether Wart, Tear of the Goddess, Diamond Vapor, and a Diamond.%n%nThen toss it in the Witch's Cauldron IN ORDER, before also tossing in a page from the Book of Biomes (Extended) (craft it with a piece of paper while on the page of the biome you want), followed by a bit of Gunpowder.%nThen just use a bottle to get the brew. If wearing your Robes or Hat, you may even get more than one! (If you have a ton of brewing expertise, which is unlikely)%n%nIf it failed, you may not have enough Altar Power, you need 5450 at least. Try placing down a Dragon Egg or Demon Heart if you're close. Check a wiki for more details on altar power.%n%nIf you want to have more than a single changed block, then add Glowstone Dust, Blaze Rod and Attuned Stone (Charged) in order to increase the effect (and Altar Power cost slightly) by +1 for each. Do this before adding in the page.%n%nFor more detailed info, check out the Witches' Brews book. Click on Brewing, then go to the Brews: Step-by-step page. This should tell you what you need to know. For what each of the brews actually does, see the Effects page. Only Effects use Capacity, and you can have multiple.

# Quest.2419 - The Hard Way to Change Biomes
gtnh.quest2419.name=The Hard Way to Change Biomes
gtnh.quest2419.desc=Ok, to have a ritual with a size greater than zero, you need to get Coven Witches to acknowledge you and then agree to help you out. To get them to deign to speak with you, you can either infuse yourself or bind a familiar. In this quest line we'll be covering binding a familiar, but for the people who want to do infusion, you just need to make the appropriate item: Ghost of the Light, Soul of the World, Spirit of Otherwhere, or Infernal Animus, and do the appropriate Rite of Infusion. Be sure to have a Death Protection Poppet to protect you, because the ritual kills you. If playing hardcore, definitely test in a separate world first.%n%nTo bind a familiar, first, summon a Demon and tear out it's heart. No, seriously, go do it. Use an Arthana with Looting III for the best chances. If you don't know how to summon one, refer to page 49/50 of the Circle Magic book for the correct Rite of Summoning.%n%nYou'll need a Mutating Sprig for the next part.

# Quest.2420 - More Hearts for Valentines
gtnh.quest2420.name=More Hearts for Valentines
gtnh.quest2420.desc=If you want to get more hearts, you can try trading with the Demon, but they're more likely to shoot fireballs at you than trade. Unless you have this item that is! First, make the Polynesia Charm that allows you to trade with animals (probably not worth it in this pack), then use the demon heart to make the Devil's Tongue Charm. With this, not only are they a lot less likely to attack, they will even sell their brethren's hearts for a little less.%n%nJust remember that it can only be used a limited number of times, ok? It might also be worthwhile to use the Rite of Protection at the same time as summoning a demon. To do so just put down both circles, and meet the item (and Altar Power) requirements of both. If you're not planning on killing the demon, you should probably send it back when you're done with the Rite of Banishing on page 47/48 of the Circle Magic book.

# Quest.2421 - Are You Grassping What I'm Telling You?
gtnh.quest2421.name=Are You Grassping What I'm Telling You?
gtnh.quest2421.desc=To make Grasspers, first you need to arrange Grass in the cardinal directions around a Chest above a block of water. Then right-click the Chest with your Mutating Sprig.

# Quest.2422 - PETA Approved*
gtnh.quest2422.name=PETA Approved*
gtnh.quest2422.desc=To make Critter Snares, first you need to arrange Alder Saplings in the cardinal directions around a Cobweb above a block of water. Then get a zombie to walk onto it and right-click the Cobweb with your Mutating Sprig.%nThis will change the Saplings into the needed Critter Snares. Do this twice.%n%n§3* May not be PETA approved

# Quest.2423 - Mad Science is the Best Science
gtnh.quest2423.name=Mad Science is the Best Science
gtnh.quest2423.desc=Next we need to fill our snares up with some critters, specifically Bats and Slimes. For the Bats, just place them beneath you and AFK if your warp is high enough to spawn bats, otherwise...uh, go caving?%n%nFor the Slimes, if you can't find any just use the Maze Slimes from the Minoshroom maze in the Twilight Forest for this. After you get them, also go collect a Wolf and an Ocelot (Lassos or Soul Vials are great for this).%n%nNow we'll be creating new life, specifically Toads and Owls. Arrange a Cobweb above a water block with grasspers at the diagonals and one of the two sets of snares in the cardinal directions. Place Attuned Stone (Charged) in one of the Grasspers, and Mutandis Extremis in the other 3. Then place one of the two animals in the center and right-click with your Mutating Sprig like when making the snares. Use the Wolf with the Bats, and the Ocelot with the Slimes. The tamed versions also work.%n%nCongratulations, you've defied the natural order and created new life! Hopefully they didn't run away because you created them outside :(%n%nMake sure to breed them for the next part. Use Raw Porkchop or Raw Beef for Owls, and Rotten Flesh for Toads to both tame and breed them.

# Quest.2424 - Finally Binding a Familiar
gtnh.quest2424.name=Finally Binding a Familiar
gtnh.quest2424.desc=Now that you have Toads and Owls, you can choose between them and Cats to bind. Why didn't we just bind a Cat earlier? Well, you'll need them both soon anyways, and who doesn't love choices? To carry out the Rite of Binding (P6, Circle Magic), you'll need to distill some Demonic Blood. Do that now, and collect the rest of the items needed.%n%nAfter collecting the items, bind your familiar using them. Make sure you have enough Altar Power. Remember that each has different benefits. See the official wiki for details. You may receive a tiny portion of damage your familiar receives (and vice-versa), so park it somewhere safe. Also note that if it dies, so will you (Supposedly). You can resummon it if it dies or was dismissed previously (like if you died). If you're in hardcore mode and don't want to risk having it around, it can be dismissed by right-clicking while sneaking when it's sitting.%n%nNow go murder a few of your new friends and tear of their Owlet's Wings, and cut off their Toe of Frog. Remember to use an Arthana. The next step needs a Seer's Stone.

# Quest.2425 - Greenhouses on Mountains, Hell on Earth
gtnh.quest2425.name=Greenhouses on Mountains, Hell on Earth
gtnh.quest2425.desc=You're almost there! To actually use the ritual, you need to recruit a coven first. Find some Coven Witches and complete their quests:%nThe means to control the dead -> Necromantic Stone%nThe beating means to master the infernal dimension -> Demon Heart%nI must perform many curses, bring me the necessary brew -> Brew of the Grotesquex5%nI desire to predict the future -> Crystal Ball%nOr just fight something.%n%nOnce completed, they'll disappear until you need them. They will sometimes appear near your spawn point if you walk by it, so don't position it over lava or something, since they CAN die and reduce the number of your coven. You can have 6, with one extra appearing for Cauldron work. Consider keeping some extras around in a dungeon just in case.%n%nAfter you recruit your coven, you just need a few things for the ritual itself: Spider Eye, Toe of Frog, Wool of Bat, Tongue of Dog, Owlet's Wing, Attuned Stone, and Attuned Stone (Charged).%n%nTo specify the biome, look in the Book of Biomes, and find 1) the type (Forest, Plains, etc), and 2) the number. Type determines the foci used, and number determines the amount of Glowstone Dust used to get that specific biome. Make sure to pack up a ritual circle into a circle talisman so you don't have to redraw it, and bring some cobblestone to make a flat area (15x15, any height). Try not to do it at night unless you like dealing with infernals.%n%nTo actually do the ritual, have the ritual circle on the ground, the items (including the foci and Glowstone) in the circle, and right-click the center with the Seer's Stone.%n%nThe area affected is determined by the number of witches in your coven. It's 16 * (size of coven - 3) radius in a circular area, so 16/32/48 if it doesn't fail.%n%nUnfortunately, sometimes after logging out and back in again you may find that it didn't work correctly in specific chunks, this is (possibly) due to lack of chunk updates and it not saving the changed biome ID correctly. Just redoing the ritual doesn't really help, you'll just get patches in the same places, however placing water after the ritual and before logging out may help with this. Or use chickens. Lots of chickens.%n%nAlso, if you already have crops in the area, they'll disappear until a block update or relog.%n%n§3PS: To pack your circle back up, you need to bring your altar with you.%n

gtnh.quest2444.name=§5§lLong Distance Fluid Pipeline
gtnh.quest2444.desc=Wouldn't it be great if you could transport your oil from a far away oil spout or oil field by pipes to your base?%n%nThis is not a problem anymore. Connect your setup on the start and end point with a Long Distance Fluid Pipeline block. Inbetween use the associated pipe blocks - the total distance between endpoints must be more than 64 blocks apart (4 or more chunks). There can only be one start and end point per pipeline.%n%nTo actually connect it, you need to align the start LDFP block such that the arrows are facing inwards, and the opposite side of it has a LDFPP block. Put a pump on the side of the block that has the arrows and set to import. It will now attempt to import fluid to the endpoint LDFP. §2This will go as fast as you can put fluid into it.§r%n%nDo the opposite on the far side, except you don't need a pump.%n%nNow you only need to chunkload the start and end points and the fluid will be "teleported" to you.%n%nOf course, later on you'll probably use ender tanks to §oactually§r teleport the fluid, especially from other dims.%n%nThis setup is lag-free in the pipe blocks, so it's useful in your base as well if you want to reduce lag.

gtnh.quest2505.name=AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2505.desc=The main processor for 2^3, 16^3, and 128^3 essentia cells.%n%nHave you ever wanted to pack up and move your entire base, but thought it was too much of a pain? Wish you could just teleport the whole thing? Well now you, uh, still can't, because GT blocks DO NOT PLAY WELL with being teleported by AE spatial stuff. Like, world corruption level bad. But you could make a teleporter I guess?

# Quest.2506 - AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2506.name=AE Spatial Storage

# Quest.2509 - AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2509.name=AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2509.desc=Contains up to a 2^3 area inside it. This is 8 blocks, so if you just want to teleport yourself, you don't need to make the later ones.

# Quest.2510 - AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2510.name=AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2510.desc=Contains up to a 16^3 area inside it. This is 4096 blocks.

# Quest.2511 - AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2511.name=AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2511.desc=Contains up to a 128^3 area inside it. This is 2,097,152 blocks. Teleport a village to the Moon to make them suffer!

# Quest.2513 - Exporting Essentia From the Network
gtnh.quest2513.name=Exporting Essentia From the Network
gtnh.quest2513.desc=Does exactly what it says. But you probably won't need it much, if at all.

# Quest.2514 - Pulling Essentia Into the Network
gtnh.quest2514.name=Pulling Essentia Into the Network
gtnh.quest2514.desc=Attach to either Alembics or the output of the Advanced Alchemical Furnace. If that doesn't work, have them pipe to a jar and import from there. You can finally get rid of your shifty-eyed golems.

# Quest.2515 - Centi-vis in your network
gtnh.quest2515.name=Centi-vis in your network
gtnh.quest2515.desc=You can use this device to either transfer the contents (CV) of a Vis Relay to another vis relay, an Arcane Assembler, or an Arcane Crafting Terminal. Either way, place the relay on the device (and send some CV to it), and use the memory card to link to the second device. If you send it to another Vis Relay Interface, you'll obviously need another Vis Relay on the other side.

# Quest.2516 - Storing Essentia in Jars? Why, again?
gtnh.quest2516.name=Storing Essentia in Jars? Why, again?
gtnh.quest2516.desc=So apparently you can attach this to a void/oblivion jar and have it void overflow if you set the priority low. Neat, huh?%n%nWhat? Store essentia in jars? Seriously? I guess you could, if you really wanted to, or if there were new, larger jars...

# Quest.2517 - Magic Terminals
gtnh.quest2517.name=Magic Terminals
gtnh.quest2517.desc=The Arcane Crafting Terminal is the terminal version on the Arcane Workbench. It can hold a set of vis discount gear in it's inventory in addition to a wand.

# Quest.2519 - Illuminated Panels
gtnh.quest2519.name=Illuminated Panels
gtnh.quest2519.desc=All terminals are made from these. You'll probably want several.

# Quest.2520 - Making the Assline Easier
gtnh.quest2520.name=Making the Assline Easier

# Quest.2521 - Making Patterns Quick
gtnh.quest2521.name=Making Patterns Quick
gtnh.quest2521.desc=The Pattern Encoder will allow you to use NEIs shift-click ? button functionality to create a crafting pattern even if you don't have the appropriate items.%n%nHowever, you can also drag the items from NEI to do the same thing, though much slower, because you have to look up each component. This is vastly less useful for processing patterns, since it's always 64 items though.

# Quest.2522 - Visualizing How Much Your Stuff
gtnh.quest2522.name=Visualizing How Much Your Stuff
gtnh.quest2522.desc=The ME Storage Monitor allows you to visualize how much of an item you have. For example you can tell if you're running low on circuitsand should make more, or how a long crafting process is proceeding. There are a couple of ways to use them.%n%nRightclick with item: Will display the current level of that item if not locked.%nRightclick with empty hand: Will reset the display if not locked.%nRightclick with AE2 wrench or network tool: Will toggle the lock.%n%n%nThe ME Conversion Monitor is the upgraded version of the ME Storage Monitor. It adds the ability to directly withdraw from or store items into the ME Network. It has the normal interactions, plus more.%n%nShift-right-clicking with item: Attempts to insert the item stack into the network. This works even if it's not the displayed item!%nShift-double-right-clicking: Attempts to insert all item stacks of the type displayed into the network.%nRight-clicking (while locked): Attempts to pull out a stack of the item displayed.

gtnh.quest2525.name=Out of Polytetrafluoroethylene? Turn on the LCR!
gtnh.quest2525.desc=It's basically the same as a fluid detector cover, except it detects based on what's in your network. Click a cell into the center to specify, and an empty hand to clear.%n%n§4These are ULTRA laggy, do not use unless they've been fixed somehow.

# Quest.2526 - Essentia Level Emitter

gtnh.quest2528.desc=This block provides unlimited AE for your network.

# Quest.2529 - Beam Me Up, Scotty
gtnh.quest2529.name=Beam Me Up, Scotty
gtnh.quest2529.desc=If you want to teleport stuff around using these, you'll need a drive in the SIOP, and at least 6 pylons hooked up. The pylons need to indicate the X, Y and Z dimensions, with you needing 1 more than you would think. If the efficiency goes below 100%, the AE cost will balloon enormously, so add more pylons to counteract that. After using a redstone signal to activate the SIOP, the blocks will be moved to the spatial IO dim, and the drive will move to the output, so you can send it somewhere else. This is very important to do properly if you want to use it as a teleporter. Otherwise you can get stuck there. Your network will need to be able to hold all the power needed to teleport at once, so you'll need at least one energy cell. You can only have one Pylon setup per controller, so consider putting them on a subnetwork.%n%nUsing 2 in the X and Z dimensions and 3 in the Y will give you a 1x2x1 teleporter to teleport yourself. You'll want a SIOP port on each side for sending and for receiving. But you'll still need to design a redstone contraption to activate them properly!  %n%nRead this if you want to know more about spatial IO in general, and larger setups: https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/3c2b2r/a_treatise_on_nocheat_smp_ae2_spatial_io/%nAlso see this if you want to see a fancy teleporter: https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/2mhrf8/ae2_spatial_transporters/%n%n§4Spatial cells, once used, will only work in the XYZ dimensions first used, with no way to format or recraft. Test in creative first!%n%nExpect your world to lag for a second after using, blame AE.

# Quest.2530 - Spring Cleaning
gtnh.quest2530.name=Spring Cleaning
gtnh.quest2530.desc=So, when you first started AE, maybe you dumped a bunch of your items into 1k drives, but now you want to clean them up, or empty them to reuse them in making higher tier ones. The ME IO Port will allow you to fill or empty your drives by connecting to the rest of the network.%n%nYou can use the Cell Workbench to format your drives, so they'll only contain the stuff you want. Remember, more item types mean less space overall. You can set them to lapis for example, then put them in the ME IO Port with the transfer direction to the drive to fill it with only that item. Don't put in an unformatted drive while using storage drawers to store tons of stuff! If you want to move your stuff around, put in new drives, then empty old ones, or disconnect your storage drawers temporarily.%n%nYou can use the Workbench to format fluid drives too, and even use cells instead of buckets.%n%nCell Workbenches do not connect to the network, so they don't need a channel.

# Quest.2531 - Formatting Gas-er, Essentia
gtnh.quest2531.name=Formatting Gas-er, Essentia
gtnh.quest2531.desc=This is the essentia version.

# Quest.2532 - Alpha and Omega
gtnh.quest2532.name=Alpha and Omega
gtnh.quest2532.desc=The ME Annihilation Plane destroys blocks as if you had mined them, and places them into the network. The Identity version acts as if silk touch was used.%n%nThe ME Formation Plane does the opposite, it places blocks into the world. You'll need to tell it what to place/drop though. This can work in both block and item mode.

# Quest.2533 - Fluid Placement
gtnh.quest2533.name=Fluid Placement
gtnh.quest2533.desc=Did you know that dispensers with a bucket will place or pick up fluid blocks in front of them after receiving a redstone signal? Well, this is the technological version. Remember it'll only work on fluids that can be placed down, ok? This is different from whether there's a bucket version or not.

# Quest.2534 - Moar Patterns!
gtnh.quest2534.name=Moar Patterns!
gtnh.quest2534.desc=You may have noticed that the ME Interface's GUI is different that before. That is because with this card you can have more patterns, adding 9 more per card up to a total of 36. HOWEVER, it also uses 4 times the energy for every item when crafting, and this is multiplicative for each new card. If doing large crafts, make sure you have some dense energy cells ready.%n%nSo basically: (sum of amounts of items in the pattern) * config multiplier (which is 10 for GTNH). with cards, it's also multiplied by 4^(number of upgrades)%n%nE.g: (wood log -> planks) in the interface w/o upgrades would draw: 1*10 AE units, which is 5 EU (remember 1 EU = 2 AE)%n(9 charcoal -> charcoal block) compressor recipe in the interface with 3 upgrades will draw 9*10*4^3*0.5 = 2070 EU, but only 45EU without any cards%n%nThey're kind of expensive, so consider holding off if you can't afford the material or EU costs. If you remove it, all the extra patterns will pop out, so be careful of that when moving your stuff.

# Quest.2535 - Singular Singularities Signify Something
gtnh.quest2535.name=Singular Singularities Signify Something
gtnh.quest2535.desc=Quest names are hard sometimes, ok? To make a Singularity (for the Quantum Network Bridge), you'll need to dump 512,000 items into the Matter Condenser set to Singularity Mode, while using a 64k component or higher.%n%nThen put the Singularity and Enderpearl Dust on the ground and use an explosion (Tiny TNT works well) to create two Quantum Entangled Singularities.%n%nQESs are each a unique pair.

# Quest.2536 - Quantum Bridging Your Outposts
gtnh.quest2536.name=Quantum Bridging Your Outposts
gtnh.quest2536.desc=A Quantum Network Bridge allows you to connect faraway places to your main AE network, even in other dimensions. So you can shove that pollution producing Mega EBF in the Void where it belongs, but still use it from the safety of your main base. To create this, you'll need a Quantum Link Chamber surrounded by Quantum Rings. Then put an Quantum Entangled Singularity in the link chamber, and connect to one of the 4 Quantum Rings around it with a fluix cable. They cost 1000EU/t for each pair.%n%nYou can power the other side from the first, but you need to jumpstart it first, so bring an energy cell when setting it up. Remember that it's part of the same network, so you can only have one controller, and you're still limited by the channels of the cable you connected with, so you may wish to use the P2P Tunnel to bring more across.%n%nIf you use several, you may wish to rename the QESs.

# Quest.2537 - Tools of the Trade
gtnh.quest2537.name=Tools of the Trade
gtnh.quest2537.desc=The Network Tool is AE2's main utility tool.%n%nRight-click on a network to see the power usage, and what makes up the network.%nRight-click on air to interact with it's inventory to store cards or turn facades transparent.%nShift-right-click to remove fixtures (import bus, interface, etc) that don't take up a full block without removing the cable, or remove any AE block immediately the same way.%n%nThe Network Visualizer does exactly what it says, it allows you to visualize the channels of your network. First, right-click a network to select it. At first you'll see everything, but you can change the modes by holding shift and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down to see different things. Remember that if you have a subnetwork, like one that P2P tunnels go through for example, those nodes won't show up since it's a different network, but the P2P tunnels entrances and exits will. This goes through solid objects, so you can look at your whole base.

# Quest.2538 - Portable Digital Storage
gtnh.quest2538.name=Portable Digital Storage
gtnh.quest2538.desc=They're exactly what they sound like. %n%nThe first is for items and acts like a terminal. It can hold 4,032 of a single item.%n%nThe second is for liquids, and acts like the fluid terminal. It can hold 128 buckets of a single liquid.%n%nIt costs AE to put things in, take them out, or have the interface open. Use the Wireless Charger from EIO if you don't want it to take forever.

# Quest.2539 - Deck of Cards
gtnh.quest2539.name=Deck of Cards
gtnh.quest2539.desc=These cards add additional functionality to certain devices or fixtures. They specify what devices they work on in the tooltip.%n%nThe Redstone Card adds redstone interactivity to the devices it can be used on, with the following options:%nAlways active, active with or without redstone signal, activate once per pulse.%n%nThe Capacity Card adds more slots for items that use them. If you add this to an Export Bus, an icon is added to select item priority.%n%nThe Crafting Card allows you to automatically request autocrafting of items.%nIn an ME Interface, if you put in items to be stocked, if there aren't enough, it'll craft them until it reaches the selected amount. Remember that these are being stocked for crafting recipes that the ME Interface has. If you want them to be seen by the network, you'll need to put a storage bus on the ME Interface.%n%nIn an ME Level Emitter, in the first mode, it'll emit a redstone signal while the specific item is being crafted. In the second, it will emit a redstone signal once a crafting job for the item has been requested, but§4§r §4it won't send the items to be crafted.§r This is useful if you're using a dummy pattern, and are using the level emitter to tell something else to happen. You still need to get the item(s) requested back into the system so it doesn't tie up a crafting CPU though.%n%nIn an ME Export Bus, it'll attempt to send whatever item(s) are selected in the export bus' GUI. In the first mode, it'll send available items first, then create crafting jobs for the rest. In the second mode, it will only send crafted items.%n%nThe Acceleration Card makes the device/fixture work faster. You'll probably want a lot of these.%n%nThe Inverter Card allows you to invert the item filter of certain fixtures.%n%nThe Fuzzy Card allows you to apply fuzzy logic to filtering to allow items with different NBT or damage data to be counted as the same. This is different from metadata. If you just want it to be fuzzy for nbt, set to Match Any. If it is set to 99%, it will work on anything that is damaged. You can use the Inverter Card to reverse this.

# Quest.2540 - Fluids of the Trade
gtnh.quest2540.name=Fluids of the Trade
gtnh.quest2540.desc=The ME Fluid Auto Filler will add crafting recipes for any fluid in your network that has a bucket version. When crafting a water bucket for example, it will send a bucket to it, and the filled water bucket back.%n%nThe ME Fluid Assembler acts like a combined Molecular Assember and ME Interface for recipes that require fluids (but not processing recipes). It will accept both buckets and cells in the recipe patterns, but doesn't use them when crafting, it just sends the fluid directly. The MEFAF is sad :(.

# Quest.2541 - Wireless 1.5
gtnh.quest2541.name=Wireless 1.5
gtnh.quest2541.desc=You can add different terminals (fluid, essentia) to the Wireless Terminal to make the Wireless Universal Terminal. However... essentia doesn't work, and crafting only works if the crafting terminal was used as the base.

# Quest.2542 - Wireless 2.0
gtnh.quest2542.name=Wireless 2.0
gtnh.quest2542.desc=This is the good wireless terminal. It even has crafting. There's a bit of lag when you open it, but the convenience it worth it, right? You can't pull out fluids, but you can hold on to the universal one if you want.%n%nThe Magnet Card does not pull items to you. Instead, it allows you to automatically deposit them into the network. You can right-click to change the white/blacklist, or shift-right-click to change the mode.

# Quest.2543 - Wireless 3.0
gtnh.quest2543.name=Wireless 3.0
gtnh.quest2543.desc=This upgrade allows unlimited range. You don't even need a Wireless Access Point!%n%n§4Extremely buggy, unfortunately. May randomly disappear, or fall out of the terminal at any time.%n%n§3Many bugs were fixed. Maybe its better now?

# Quest.2544 - Cut the Power!
gtnh.quest2544.name=Cut the Power!
gtnh.quest2544.desc=The ME Toggle Bus allows you to cut off access through a cable if it doesn't receive a redstone signal. The inverted version is, well, inverted. It must be placed between the cables, like a Quartz Fiber.

# Quest.2545 - Providing Essentia on Demand
gtnh.quest2545.name=Providing Essentia on Demand
gtnh.quest2545.desc=The Essentia and Infusion Providers both do basically the same thing, send essentia to a device that requests it for crafting.%n%nThe Essentia Provider needs to be next to the device, it's mostly for the Thaumatorium. Since it's effectively a magic ME Interface, you can also use it instead of an Essentia Import Bus next to your Alembics or the Advanced Alchemical Furnace.%n%nThe Infusion Provider is for devices that draw essentia through the air, like the Runic Matrix (infusion) or Overchanting Table. It doesn't need to be next to the device.%n%nThey both obviously need the essentia they request to be accessible by the network to work.

# Quest.2546 - Ordering Essentia
gtnh.quest2546.name=Ordering Essentia
gtnh.quest2546.desc=The Distillation Pattern Encoder allows you to automatically melt down items in your alchemical furnace to provide essentia.%nFirst, place something that is already scanned in the device, along with a blank pattern. You can create the pattern by clicking the button, or click the different aspects to select one that is not the highest. This will create a pattern of item -> essentia. Then use an ME Interface pointing at a furnace with the pattern in it. You can now craft that type of essentia the same way you would a normal craft, but through the Essentia Terminal.%n%n§4There isn't a way to have the system craft essentia on demand for a craft unfortunately.§r%n%n

# Quest.2547 - Autocrafting Magic Stuff
gtnh.quest2547.name=Autocrafting Magic Stuff
gtnh.quest2547.desc=The Arcane Assembler works like a combination of the Molecular Assembler and the Arcane Workbench, allowing you to autocraft anything crafted in the latter. You need to link a vis relay through the network to supply essentia to it, and a Knowledge Core with recipes on it for to work. Additionally, you can add vis discount gear into the interface to take advantage of the discount. The base discount starts at 20%. For each Acceleration card, the time taken will reduce by 20%, and increase power used by 50%. For every point of warp on the discount gear, the power costs increase by 15%.%n%nThe knowledge core holds up to 21 patterns for use in the Arcane Assembler, but you need a new assembler for every knowledge core if you want to autocraft more than that.%n%nTo encode the patterns, you need a Knowledge Inscriber. It works exactly as you would expect. It doesn't connect to the network, so it doesn't need a channel. If you want to erase a pattern select it and the save icon should become erase instead.%n

# Quest.2548 - Miscellaneous AE Items
gtnh.quest2548.name=Miscellaneous AE Items
gtnh.quest2548.desc=There are several AE items that aren't particularly useful, but probably deserve mention, so here they are:%n%nCertus Tanks: They hold 32B and are portable and easy to make.%n%nView Cell: Format in a Cell Workbench to filter what you see in a terminal (when they're installed in it)%n%nCertus/Nether Quartz Cutting Knifes: Right-click to open interface. Place an iron ingot in the slot, and choose a name. The press can be used in the Inscriber to name stuff without using an anvil. You can also rename p2p tunnels and interfaces in world with the knife.%n%nME Drive Fixture: Only holds 6 cells instead of 10.%n%nME Energy Cell Fixture: Requires a channel for some reason. Also, §4it doesn't work.§r%n%nME Block Container: Holds only one type of item, but the amount of a 64k drive. Can place the item in world, or replace in a 1x1 or 3x3 area. Blocks replaced will be dumped in world. This will be horizontal or vertical depending on which side of a block you select. Shift-right click air to change mode, right click a block to activate mode.%n%nCharged Quartz Fixture: Emits light at the same level as a torch, but fancier.%n%nLight Detecting Fixture: Emits redstone signal based on light. Since it only starts at 7, it's not as useful as the Light Sensor.%n%nME Upgrade (Tier 1/2/3): If you're an OC person, there's 3 upgrades you can make to add access to your network from robots and drones.%nT1: 0.5 access point range%nT2: Normal access point range%nT3: Unlimited range, any dim%n%nEntropy Manipulator: Changes grass/dirt/dried dirt into each other, or starts fires. Or melts ice. Useless.%n%nMatter Cannon: Shoots Matter Balls made in the Matter Condensor. Put it in an ME Chest or Drive and put items in a Terminal to fill. Decent I guess? But it destroys blocks every time you use it, so... Well, I guess you could use it with Paint Balls?%n%nColor Applicator: Use dye items or Paint Balls (more efficient) to dye stuff. You can dye cables, or anything Forge-compatible, like wool or glass. Place items inside like the Matter Cannon. You can cycle through the colors by holding shift and right-clicking, or scrolling the mouse wheel. If you use snow balls, you can remove paint instead. You can also use it in a dispensor.%n%nME Fluid Pattern [WIP]: §YYou're supposed to use it in a fluid terminal if there's no bucket version of a fluid to be able to make a crafting pattern with that fluid. However, §4it doesn't work.§r Also useless since we have cells.%n%nWalrus: It's a walrus, what were you expecting?

# Quest.2549 - Magical Minions
gtnh.quest2549.name=Magical Minions
gtnh.quest2549.desc=You can use the Wireless Golem Backpack to connect your golem to the network if it's close enough to an access point. See the Thaumonomicon for details.%n%n

# Quest.2561 - §6§lBacterial Vat
gtnh.quest2561.name=§6§lBacterial Vat
gtnh.quest2561.desc=The Bacterial Vat is a unique multiblock machine with its own recipes. But it also has advanced versions of many brewery recipes.%n%nThe Vat isn't mandatory in this tier, but there are many useful recipes and you'll need it later on, so let's build one!%n%nAll recipes require a §cculture§r, some recipes require a specific §cGlass-Tier.%n%n§rThe culture is made in a BioLab and §lput in the controller.%n%n§l§rThe Glass-Tier is calculated as LV = Tier 1, so this quest requires you to make tier 3 glass.

# Quest.2563 - §6§lSievert for the Vat
gtnh.quest2563.name=§6§lSievert for the Vat
gtnh.quest2563.desc=Some Vat recipes require a certain Sievert (radioactivity) value. So attach this Radio Hatch to your Vat to input radioactive material!%n%nThe Radio Hatch holds rods/long rods of radioactive material and uses them to produce Sievert. The input item determines the Sievert value and how long it lasts. Items stored in the hatch will be used continuously even if machine not active, so make sure you want to craft something before putting items in.%n%n§rYou can check the stats of an inputted item with a portable scanner. Higher tiers of hatch hold more, from 1kg (HV) to 6kg (UV). Rods are worth 1kg, while long rods are 2kg.%n%nSome recipes require §4exact§r sievert, you can use the screwdriver to access the radiation shutter control to adjust how much sv is blocked from being sent to the vat. For example, you need 100sv to make SeaweedBroth, so you'd use Naquadah rods, and block off 30sv.%n%nRod Stats:%nMaterial-Sievert-Apprx. time until used up%nBismuth                 83sv   198s%nUranium 235           92sv    80s%nUranium 238           92sv    80s%nPlutonium 239         94sv    66s%nPlutonium 241         94sv    66s%nNaquadah             130sv   14.5s%nEnriched Naquadah 140sv   10.5s%nNaquadria            150sv     8s%n%nThere are more radioactive materials than these, but these are the main ones.

# Quest.2564 - §6§lMaking the Vat More Efficient!
gtnh.quest2564.name=§6§lMaking the Vat More Efficient!
gtnh.quest2564.desc=Looking at the Vat's recipes you are likely discouraged by the small amount of fluid being produced per recipe. Don't worry! Fluid consumption and production shown in NEI are just the baseline for the lowest efficiency. The efficiency of Vat depends on the amount of fluid in the Output Hatch.%n%nThe efficiency gradually increases as the output hatch fills up and reaches maximum efficiency when it is §cexactly half-filled§r. If the hatch fills even more, the efficiency goes down again, so try to keep it close to half! At maximum efficiency the amount of fluid consumed and produced per recipe is multiplied by 1001. The items and culture are not affected.%n%nThere are different means to keep it at half, including OC (not SFM, it doesn't like BW fluids), fluid detector+machine controller, or a fluid regulator, as well as more off the wall ones such as frames or block-sharing. If you choose the fluid detector route, remember that using a larger output hatch will make it easier to keep it close to half-filled.

# Quest.2600 - §c§lFetch Quests
gtnh.quest2600.name=§c§lFetch Quests
gtnh.quest2600.desc=To make the Circuit Assembly Line imprints you'll need a bunch of new materials.%n%nTo start, let's get some raw materials, Prasiolite, Cubic Zirconia, and Tellurium.%n%nYou also need some other materials, but I don't need to explain those, do I?%n%n§3If the materials are too much of a pain, you can replicate some of them once you have one of it.

# Quest.2601 - §c§l§6§e§6§lCircuit Assembly Line
gtnh.quest2601.name=§c§l§6§e§6§lCircuit Assembly Line
gtnh.quest2601.desc=You'll need all of this to create 4 CALs, enough for a single series of circuits. If you only want one (for the microprocessors for example), just divide by 4.%n%nAssuming you got the necessary imprints on the LuV tab, you can now craft the CALs for the crystalprocessor series. We're starting with 4 since you'll need one per circuit, the imprint is not removable. And yes this means you need one for every circuit type you want to make with the CAL.%n%nAs an Assembly Line, it generally works like the normal one, with different items in each bus, but since it's only one item per CAL, it's far easier to use, and the recipe is cheaper too.%n%nThe CAL uses 'wraps' to make 16 of a circuit at a time (aside from ULV and LV circuits), saving you time, EU, and Soldering Alloy. You make the wraps in an Assembler with 16 of the item and Polyethylene.%n%n§3BTW you can change out the Hatches and Busses for better ones, but you still need to keep ingredient order. Also CAL grants perfect overclock.

# Quest.2602 - §c§lImprints, They're Important
gtnh.quest2602.name=§c§lImprints, They're Important
gtnh.quest2602.desc=Now that you've finally gotten all the materials to make your imprints, you can make them as you get your new circuits. You'll need to slice the circuits for the imprint in either a tier-appropriate slicing machine, or the Cutting Factory in slicing mode.%n%nTo use the imprints, place them in the CAL controller's item slot. The CAL will be imprinted once you turn it on. You can see what it's imprinted with by using a portable scanner on the controller. You can also swap out controllers if you're too lazy to make more CALs.%n%n§3If you already have an imprint for an earlier version of a recipe, you don't need to make another, it works with both recipes.%n%n§4Because of the way oredicting and recipes work, slicing LV or HV circuits in the Cutting Factory will not work properly, so use at least an HV slicing machine for those.

# Quest.2603 - §c§lFetching Tellurium
gtnh.quest2603.name=§c§lFetching Tellurium
gtnh.quest2603.desc=For Tellurium, you can do it these ways:%n%n1) EBF Crushed Lead Ore for 2 Tellurium Nuggets%n2) If you have old worldgen, you can get it from Temagamite practically anywhere (it was broken so it currently doesn't generate), or Mercury if it's been fixed%n3) Make Rare Earth (III) out of Rare Earth using the strongest of acids and get it from Alburnite%n4) Toxic Everglades again%n5) Once you have a Void Miner, you can place it in the Overworld to obtain Tellurium.

# Quest.2604 - §c§lFetching Cubic Zirconia
gtnh.quest2604.name=§c§lFetching Cubic Zirconia
gtnh.quest2604.desc=For Cubic Zirconia, you'll need to combine Zirconium and Yttrium Oxide in the EBF as well. Fortunately you only need the dusts.%n%nYou can get Zirconium from:%n1) The Red Zircon ore on Ross128b <- Do this one%n2) Sifting Cassiterite, Tin, or Ilmenite <- Do this one if you hate Ross%n3) Chemical Bathing Tin or Rutile with Chlorine%n%nOxygen isn't hard to get, but the Yttrium more than makes up for it. You have a couple options:%n1) Make Rare Earth (I) out of Rare Earth (see the MV quest) and get it out of Xenotime%n2) Make Rare Earth (II) out of Rare Earth using a stronger acid and get it from Yttriaite%n3) When you have a T6 rocket, you can pick some Yttrium ore up from Triton, making you cry at how much easier it is%n4) In ZPM you can try going to the Toxic Everglades to grab weird GT++ ores, some of which have Yttrium in them (Yay RNG ore worldgen!)%n%nTo get Rare Earth you §ocan§r use Redstone or Skystone, but you can also get it out of Monazite directly or some other ores as a byproduct. Hopefully you saved it up?

# Quest.2605 - §c§lFetching Prasiolite
gtnh.quest2605.name=§c§lFetching Prasiolite
gtnh.quest2605.desc=For Prasiolite you'll want to put Quartzite and Amethyst in an EBF to get Flawed Prasiolite. You'll need to either use the Implosion Compressor or Precision Laser Engraver to up the quality to Exquisite. You'll also need the dust version as well, so don't convert them all.%n%nFor the amount of Amethyst you'll need, you'll want to make a stop on Venus.%n%nIf you have a T5 rocket, you can get the ore from Ross128ba directly and run it through the sifter.

gtnh.quest2651.desc=In order to make Wetware circuits, you'll need Sterilized Growth Medium and Stemcells, so let's get started on those, ok?%n%nTo get anywhere, first you need Bacteria. You can get this through the vat or the brewing machine. Vat way is more efficient, but you need culture for it so you first need to do brewing way. Vat needs Bismuth rods for radiation and EV-tier glass. There are also 3 recipes, so you can use a higher tier one later if you like.%n%nYou'll also need Mince Meat and Agar. You'll want a stable supply of meat, so something like the a fish farm, a standard animal farm, or IC2 Meatrose or Goldfish is probably best.%n%nAgar has a more complicated processing chain, but it's nothing compared to Platinum. You'll need even more meat for it.%n%nUse some of the Bacteria to create an Ova Evolutionis culture (15% chance), and then use that in the vat's controller to make Raw Growth Medium.

# Quest.2656 - Wetware Mainframe
gtnh.quest2656.name=Wetware Mainframe
gtnh.quest2656.desc=The Wetware Mainframe is the final Wetware Circuit, and it is the first UHV Circuit you can get.%n%nIt's made in the Assembling Line, so there's no imprint.

# Quest.2657 - It's Not Going Bad, I Swear!
gtnh.quest2657.name=It's Not Going Bad, I Swear!
gtnh.quest2657.desc=To make your next tier of circuits (Bio Circuits), you need to make Raw Bio Medium. There are three ways of making it.%n%nThe first one requires Stemcells, Unknown Crystal and T-Ceti Seaweed Extract at LuV voltage and 94 Sievert (Plutonium level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 4:1 ratio.%n%nThe second one is basically the first one, but it requires Infinity Catalyst instead of Tritanium at ZPM voltage and 140 Sievert (Enriched Naquadah level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 1:1 ratio.%n%nThe third one is the most efficient, but it requires Biocells (which you don't have yet), and 4 dust of Infinity Catalyst at UV voltage and 150 Sievert (Naquadria level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 1:2 ratio.%n%n§3The second and third ways use a different culture.

# Quest.2658 - Making Tritanium
gtnh.quest2658.name=Making Tritanium
gtnh.quest2658.desc=In order to make Tritanium, first you need to make Duranium.%n%nTritanium is used for the T6 rocket, Gravisuit, the T4 mining multi, and UHV circuits.

# Quest.2659 - I'm Telling You, It's Not Mold!
gtnh.quest2659.name=I'm Telling You, It's Not Mold!
gtnh.quest2659.desc=Now let's make Biocells. To make them, you have to heat up your Raw Bio Medium to make Sterilized Bio Medium.%n%nThen you just have to use a Chemical Reactor to make Biocells.

# Quest.2660 - Mutations Are...Good, Right?
gtnh.quest2660.name=Mutations Are...Good, Right?
gtnh.quest2660.desc=Making the Bio Board is pretty much the same process as making a wetware board, just that... oh god that's expensive.%n%nTo make the Ultra Bio Mutated Circuit Board, you just need to etch it with neutronium.

# Quest.2661 - Self-Aware Circuits
gtnh.quest2661.name=Self-Aware Circuits
gtnh.quest2661.desc=Make a Bio Processing Unit. It is an important component in making the Bio Circuits.

# Quest.2662 - Please... Don't Let These Circuits Take Over
gtnh.quest2662.name=Please... Don't Let These Circuits Take Over
gtnh.quest2662.desc=The Bioprocessor is the first Bio Circuit you can make. It is a ZPM-Tier circuit.

# Quest.2663 - Bio Circuit 2: Biological Boogaloo
gtnh.quest2663.name=Bio Circuit 2: Biological Boogaloo
gtnh.quest2663.desc=The Bioprocessor Assembly is the second Bio Circuit. It is a UV-Tier circuit.

# Quest.2664 - Supercomputers... With Cells?
gtnh.quest2664.name=Supercomputers... With Cells?
gtnh.quest2664.desc=The Bioware Supercomputer is the third Bio Circuit. It's a UHV-Tier Circuit.

# Quest.2665 - Master of Circuits
gtnh.quest2665.name=Master of Circuits
gtnh.quest2665.desc=You've done it! This is the final (normal) circuit in the game!%n%nThe Bio Mainframe is the first and only UEV-Tier Circuit in the game.%n%nAlso, there's this thing called going outside. I heard you may like it.

# Quest.2666 - §c§lMagneto Resonatic Circuits
gtnh.quest2666.name=§c§lMagneto Resonatic Circuits
gtnh.quest2666.desc=So, you may have been looking through NEI and seen a line of purple circuits from BW and wondered 'What are these, and when can I make them?'. Well, I don't know why they exist, but you can make them starting now!%n%nThey all use Imprint Supporting Boards, a type of crystal (change the dust to crystal with Neon or Krypton in an Autoclave, and then move up tiers with the Precision Laser Engraver), SMDs, and a §3circuit of the previous tier.§r So the material cost increases rather dramatically. They're made at a power tier +1 of the circuit's tier, so IV ones are made with LuV voltage.%n%nYou can even make UHV circuits if you're crazy enough! The UIV CA has no recipe, so you can't make the UEV ones, unfortunately.

# Quest.2667 - §b§lKeep Soldering On!
gtnh.quest2667.name=§b§lKeep Soldering On!
gtnh.quest2667.desc=You have been using a very basic soldering alloy for a while now. Time for an upgrade! You will need it in your Assembling Line.

# Quest.2668 - §6§lSomething From Nothing
gtnh.quest2668.name=§6§lSomething From Nothing
gtnh.quest2668.desc=Void Miners are basically the same thing as regular ones, except that they draw from the whole pool of ores for the dimension without there having to be any nearby. In addition, you can speed them up by supplying Neon, Krypton, Xenon, or Oganesson.%n%nYou can get Neon reasonably easily from Bartimaeusnek Ore from Ross 128ba. Krypton and Xenon can be produced from centrifuging fuel rods. All three can be produced from the EV liquid air distillation method. Remember you need the Liquid Air Fluid Hatch to actually put in enough liquid air. If you want all the produced gasses from the first 4 slots, you'll need to use the Giant Output Hatch.%n%nTo get Oganesson, you'll need mk3 fusion.%n%nAll four fluids can be replicated, so you'll probably end up doing that.%n%n§3If you want the Deep Dark's ores, you HAVE to use a Void Miner.

# Quest.2669 - Wasn't This Only Found in the Center of Neutron Stars?
gtnh.quest2669.name=Wasn't This Only Found in the Center of Neutron Stars?
gtnh.quest2669.desc=You'll need Neutronium for UV and the T7 rocket, so let's make some.%n%nTo get Neutronium, go to one of the planets that has the small ores. Then mix it with Helium Plasma to make Raw Neutronium Dust. It can be smelted in a Blast Furnace at 9000K and 491,520 EU/t. This recipe takes a long time and a lot of power. Better make another EBF or Volcanus. Or a few. Or upgrade your Mega Blast Furnace.

# Quest.2670 - Which Doctor? THE Doctor
gtnh.quest2670.name=Which Doctor? THE Doctor
gtnh.quest2670.desc=If you haven't made one before, go check out the quest in MV linked from the Robot Arm about how they work. This one gives the maximum boost, 256x, and uses between 1.5M-3M EU/t, so make sure your power grid can handle it, or dial it down.

# Quest.2671 - Data Bank
gtnh.quest2671.name=Data Bank
gtnh.quest2671.desc=By now you probably feel overwhelmed with the number of data sticks needed for your assembly line. TecTech has a solution for you: The Data Bank. It allows you to store more than just 16 data sticks and can be connected to multiple Assembling Lines at the same time.%n%nPlace the controller one block above the ground and use the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector to see how it is built. You will need a Maintenance Hatch and at least an EV Energy Hatch, though the power requirements can be much higher if you use many Data Access Hatches and Data Bank Master Connectors, so you might as well go for an LuV energy hatch, which will power a maxed one. Trying to run the Data Bank and then scanning the controller will tell you how much eu/t is needed.%n%n§rYou will need more blocks then what is asked for in this quest, as the number of Data Access Hatches and Connectors is up to you. You can have a maximum of 15 combined.%n%nThe Assembly Line Slave Connector replaces your old Data Access Hatch on the Assembling Line. Connect it to a Master Connector on the Data Bank with Optical Fiber Cable and make sure to color the hatches and the cable.%n%n§3If you can't figure out what blocks to place, pay attention to the tooltip in the bottom-left when using the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector. In this case the filler blocks are Computer Casing.

# Quest.2672 - §6§lHigher Precision
gtnh.quest2672.name=§6§lHigher Precision
gtnh.quest2672.desc=You can upgrade the precise casings to unlock more recipes in precise mode and gain more parallels in normal mode.%n%n§3To make orundum check out the recipe for the orundum plate.

# Quest.2673 - Neutrons From Space
gtnh.quest2673.name=Neutrons From Space
gtnh.quest2673.desc=Now let's make Cosmic Neutronium, a material that is used in a lot of late game stuff.%nCentrifuge Black Plutonium to get a Pile of Neutrons. It can then be compressed to Cosmic Neutronium Nuggets in an Implosion Compressor.%n%nCompress the nuggets again to make a Cosmic Neutronium Ingot.%n%n§3Avaritia's Neutronium and GT Cosmic Neutronium are oredicted together, it's not the same as normal GT Neutronium. It goes back to being called SpNt if you craft it into something, like a plate.

# Quest.2674 - Compressing the Core of a Star
gtnh.quest2674.name=Compressing the Core of a Star
gtnh.quest2674.desc=The next material is Infinity Catalyst. Infinity Catalyst needs to be compressed with insane amounts of force. The only machine capable of doing that is a Neutronium Compressor. Let's make one.%n%nTo make the Catalyst, go to Vega B to get the dust. Then use the Neutronium Compressor to make Infinity Catalyst with 64 of the dust.%n%nYou can also do the insane Avaritia recipe to make the Infinity Catalyst, if you want a challenge :P%n%n§3The compressor can also be used to make singularities, culiminating in the Eternal Singularity, used in the alternate recipe.%n%nIf you want to automate singularity creation you can just click with the middle mouse button to modify the number of items in a pattern beyond the normal limits.

# Quest.2675 - One Ingot, Infinite Power
gtnh.quest2675.name=One Ingot, Infinite Power
gtnh.quest2675.desc=Here at Questbook, Inc. we are seriously worried about your health if you got here legitimately. Playing this much might be bad for you. You can always go outside, you know?%n%nBy the way, to make the ingot, it's just a simple Dire Crafting Table recipe. Remember that you were the one that chose to be here.%n%n§3A number of endgame recipes have now opened up. Check the Endgame Goals tab or NEI recipes for the Table to see what they are.%n%nSomething else to note is that there's an automated DCT if you happen to need a lot of these (hint: you will).

# Quest.2676 - Collecting Neutrons the Alternate Way
gtnh.quest2676.name=Collecting Neutrons the Alternate Way
gtnh.quest2676.desc=Now that you have Infinity, you can use the Avaritia Neutron Collector to get Piles of Neutrons. It does not use any power.%n%n§3Warning: This machine is extremely slow, so you might want to use something to help with that...

# Quest.2677 - §c§lNo, It Won't Repair Your Car
gtnh.quest2677.name=§c§lNo, It Won't Repair Your Car
gtnh.quest2677.desc=The Auto Maintenance Hatch will correct maintenance problems immediately at the cost of some materials. Invaluable if you want to make sure your cleanroom machines won't void stuff. Or you could just use a howler and do it yourself I guess.

# Quest.2678 - Paint-by-Numbers
gtnh.quest2678.name=Paint-by-Numbers
gtnh.quest2678.desc=If you want to color all those fancy cables and such, you'll want to use the humble Paintbrush. To uncolor them, use a bucket of water.%n%nAlternatively, you can also use the IC2 Painter, GT Spray Can, or the AE2 Color Applicator.

# Quest.2679 - Outsourcing the Soldering
gtnh.quest2679.name=Outsourcing the Soldering
gtnh.quest2679.desc=Soldering some of your new advanced materials is difficult. But maybe the new bio-technology you have developed can help? You should create a living solder that can do it for you! It will adjust to any challenge and join your materials at an atomic level filling all the gaps!%n%nUse your Botmium Chemical Plant to make this Mutated Living Solder. The catalyst recipe requires infinity, so best upgrade your chemical plant to Tungstensteel Pipe Casings and at least Awakened Draconium Coils to remove the durability loss on the catalyst.

# Quest.2680 - §c§lMutating Things is Cool
gtnh.quest2680.name=§c§lMutating Things is Cool
gtnh.quest2680.desc=When making Raw Crystal Chips, you have two other options if using Europium constantly is too expensive for you: Bacterial Sludge, and Mutagen.%n%nMutagen is obviously better than the sludge, but how do you get it? I'll teach you how.%n%nFirst, get the Bacterial Sludge you got from Mars, and run it through a Brewery along with some U-238 to get EnrichedBacterialSludge. Then Ferment it to get FermentedBacterialSludge. And finally you Distill it to get Mutagen.%n%nBut is a single bucket enough for you? Hardly! But now that we have some, we can make more with the vat. Use the Mutagen you got along with some of that Mysterious Crystal Dust to make a culture. Unfortunately the chances are pretty low, so you'll almost certainly have to do it several times.%n%nOnce you have your culture you can use it in the vat along with some of the dust again to make more. You'll need LuV-tier glass, and Plutonium rods.%n%nIf you want to get more Bacterial Sudge more easily, you can use the vat to make that too! The culture is much easier to make.%n%n§3Mutagen is also used for Gendustry, so if you want to do that, make a bunch.

# Quest.2681 - Industrial Scale Seaweed Production
gtnh.quest2681.name=Industrial Scale Seaweed Production
gtnh.quest2681.desc=So you probably noticed that the amount of seaweed you'll need to make Bio circuits is kind of...intense. Collecting them yourself is a huge pain, and who wants to program robots? Plus servers. Fortunately, there's now a way to make seaweed.%n%nThe first thing you need is...Seaweed! Use that with Unknown Water you pumped from the same planet to make the culture. Expect this to take a while, as the chances are super low. You'll also need the max tier Bio Lab.%n%nOnce you have the culture you can make SeaweedBroth, by combining it with UnknownNutrientAgar and some other stuff. This can then be made into seaweed.

# Quest.2682 - TecTech Multiblocks
gtnh.quest2682.name=TecTech Multiblocks
gtnh.quest2682.desc=TecTech Multiblock Common Functionality%n%nMultiple Ampere and Laser Hatches Compatibility - to ease power distribution.%n%nPower Pass - Allows connected dynamo hatches to take power from the controller and output it, just like the active transformer does (and that is why the controller always need it in it's recipe if that function is enabled...). §4Be sure to turn off Power Pass if you want to edit your machine and don't want it to explode!§r%n%nSafe Void - Enabling this moves all EM (Elemental Matter, not all machines use this) from input and output hatches to overflow hatches. Which allows the machine to be disassembled more easily.%n%nConstructable Interface - Allows visualizing the structure with blueprints (there is an API to implement that for any block, but almost nothing does).%n%nFrom left to right is 1, then clockwise for the rest in TT multi interfaces.%n%n1) Parameters - They are the way of the controller to communicate with player and parameter hatches. Lights indicate status but more detailed information can be seen when moused over. The tooltip contains ID in form of HatchID:ParameterNumber:Direction, Current Status, Current Value, and Short Description.%n%n2) Uncertainty status - These 9 blocks indicate uncertainty status of the machine. If the lights are on, this machine requires an uncertainty resolver. Red = Bad, Green = Good. You need to do the absurd puzzle before using the machine.%n%nControl buttons - Buttons might change their behavior and appearance depending on machine but usually they work like this, starting from top:%n%n3) Power Pass - Toggles Power Pass.%n%n4) Safe Void - Toggles Safe Void.%n%n5) Power Switch - Soft Mallet with your finger...%n%n6) Input slot - Standard functionality.%n

# Quest.2683 - Configuring TecTech Multiblocks
gtnh.quest2683.name=Configuring TecTech Multiblocks
gtnh.quest2683.desc=The Parametrizer allows you to configure TecTech multis by adjusting the numbers. There are 3 different versions. Let us focus on the basic one.%n%nIf there are lit up sections in the Parameters part of the multi interface (see the TecTech Multiblocks quest), you can configure the multi, otherwise the block does nothing.%n%nWe'll be using the Quantum Computer as our example, since that is what you probably want it for.%n%nFirst we need to understand the parameter naming, like ID:0:1:I. The first number represents the parameter block. For the QC only block 0 is used. Each such block can have up to 4 used parameters, 2 inputs and 2 outputs. The letter at the end specifies if a parameter is an input or output with I or O and the number in the middle distinguishes the 2 parameters of this kind in the block. It is either 0 or 1.%n%nInputs are something that is either set by the Parametrizer, or is a default. Outputs give information that the machine sends to you, that indicates things. (like heat or Computation)%n%nIn the Parametrizer's interface, the outputs are marked by a down arrow, while the inputs are indicated by an up arrow. Around that you can find 16 buttons. The outer 8 just change things by a larger quantity, as does shift clicking. So let us focus on the inner 8.%n%nIn the first row you can change the parameter block to look at or change. For the QC only block 0 is relevant, so change it to that.%n%nThe next two rows now allow us to change either the first or the second input parameter in this block by -1 or +1 per button press. You can see in the QC controller GUI that the first input parameter is the overclock ratio, while the second is the overvoltage ratio.%n%nThe bottom row is where the binary nature of the Parametrizer shows. It lets you multiply the parameters by 2 or divide them by 2. However: it changes both of them together! So if you want different values you will have to change things in the second and third row. Despite what the TecTech wiki claims, being able to divide by 2 also allows you to set non-integer values for your OC and OV ratio!

# Quest.2684 - RP-1 Rocket Fuel
gtnh.quest2684.name=RP-1 Rocket Fuel
gtnh.quest2684.desc=One option to fuel your T1 and T2 rocket is RP-1 Rocket Fuel. First, you'll need either Diesel or Coal Tar. Coal Tar is the better option on the long run, since you'll need the other products of distilling it to make other rocket fuels, but for now you can use Diesel.§3%n%nIf you're using Diesel, you need 20 cells, if using Coal Tar, you need 30. Unless you use a DT, in which case it doesn't divide evenly anymore :(§r%n%nDistill it in the Distillery to get Kerosene, then distill it again to get RP-1. You'll need a Chemical Plant for the last step.%n%nRP-1 Rocket Fuel is a T3 240 EU/t recipe, so you'll need to make the CP out of Stainless Steel and HV Machine Casings.%n%nSince there is no oxygen in space, you will also need an oxidizer. But since the Galacticraft rocket can only take one fluid we have simplified that a bit. Just combine Liquid Oxygen and RP-1 to make the fully functional RP-1 Rocket Fuel.%n%n§3If you're confused about how to use/make the Chemical Plant, refer to the manual with the same name.%n%n§2PS: You can also use Rocket Fuels for power in Rocket Engines, or the Rocketdyne F-1A Engine multi.

# Quest.2685 - Coal Tar Distilling
gtnh.quest2685.name=Coal Tar Distilling
gtnh.quest2685.desc=In order to distill Coal Tar, you need to get some first. To do so, run Charcoal, Lignite, Coal, or Coal Coke though either the Industrial Coke Oven or the Pyrolyse Oven.%n%nSince you need multiple products, use a Distillery Tower to get them all. Everything other than Naphtha is used to make Rocket Fuels.

# Quest.2686 - Dense Hydrazine
gtnh.quest2686.name=Dense Hydrazine
gtnh.quest2686.desc=Dense Hydrazine is needed starting from rocket tier 3, so you should make some if you want to keep exploring space.%n%nIt's a T4 240 EU/t recipe, so you'll need to build Chemical Plant out of Titanium and HV Machine Casings.

# Quest.2687 - Monomethylhydrazine
gtnh.quest2687.name=Monomethylhydrazine
gtnh.quest2687.desc=You'll need this if you want to make CN3H7O3 (Purple) Rocket Fuel. It's also made in the Chemical Plant.%n%n§3Look up recipe for CN3H7O3 to properly see recipe for Monomethylhydrazine.

# Quest.2688 - CN3H7O3 (Purple) Rocket Fuel
gtnh.quest2688.name=CN3H7O3 (Purple) Rocket Fuel
gtnh.quest2688.desc=To make CN3H7O3 for your T5 rocket, you'll need to combine Monomethylhydrazine and Nitric Acid in a Chemical Plant. Make sure to upgrade your casings to Tungstensteel.

# Quest.2689 - Phtalic Acid Conversion
gtnh.quest2689.name=Phtalic Acid Conversion
gtnh.quest2689.desc=If you have a bunch of this lying around already (or you think it's easier), you can convert GT Phtalic acid into the GT++ version by running it through a Distillery.

# Quest.2690 - 2-Ethylanthrahydroquinone
gtnh.quest2690.name=2-Ethylanthrahydroquinone
gtnh.quest2690.desc=To make this complicated sounding chemical, combine the similarly named 2-Ethylanthraquinone and Hydrogen along with an Orange Catalyst in the Chemical Plant.%n%n§3You need Palladium to make the Catalyst, so keep that in mind.

# Quest.2691 - 2-Ethylanthraquinone
gtnh.quest2691.name=2-Ethylanthraquinone
gtnh.quest2691.desc=Does anyone else wonder why these chemicals have numbers in the name? No? Just me? Moving on, to make it, combine Phthalic Anhydride and Ethylbenzene in the Chemical Plant to make 2-Ethylanthraquinone.%n%nBTW the other recipe that makes this is used later in the processing chain. You can loop the 2-Ethylanthraquinone so you don't have to make more if you don't want to scale up.%n%n§3You need Palladium for the next quest.

# Quest.2692 - How Do You Even Pronounce This?
gtnh.quest2692.name=How Do You Even Pronounce This?
gtnh.quest2692.desc=To make Phthalic Anhydride, use a dehydrator. You need to use GT++ Phthalic Acid.

# Quest.2693 - Phthalic Acid, The Cool Kids' Way
gtnh.quest2693.name=Phthalic Acid, The Cool Kids' Way
gtnh.quest2693.desc=Make Phthalic Acid out of Naphthalene and Lithium in a Chemical Reactor.%n%nIronically, you can't make this out of Naphtha.

# Quest.2694 - Naphthalene
gtnh.quest2694.name=Naphthalene
gtnh.quest2694.desc=To make Naphthalene, combine your Coal Oil Tar with Sulfuric Acid to get Sulfuric Coal Tar Oil.%n%nThen distill it to get Naphthalene. Seem easy? It gets harder.

# Quest.2695 - Serious Upgrades
gtnh.quest2695.name=Serious Upgrades
gtnh.quest2695.desc=So if you thought 'hey, the purple stuff wasn't that bad, why not make the green?', well, first of all, you may need professional help. Second, you're going to need to be in ZPM to make the casings you need, full stop. You need a ZPM ABS for the components, so come back once you've made a ZPM Energy Hatch.%n%nYou can probably figure most of it out on your own, but keep in mind that some of the materials need to be created in the ABS, solidified, macerated, and then used in another ABS recipe. Examples are: Hastelloy-N and Inconel-792.%n%nLaurenium is also like this, and also inclues Rhenium and Dysprosium. Rhenium uses a nonstandard ABS recipe to make, and Dysprosium requires either making Rare Earth (III) or going to the Toxic Everglades. You'll also need to make Rare Earth (I) for Ytterbium or, again, visit the Everglades for it.%n%nHave fun with that!%n%n§3You'll almost certainly need more than this, but the exact amount, as always, depends on your hatches and busses.

# Quest.2696 - Beyond the Limit
gtnh.quest2696.name=Beyond the Limit
gtnh.quest2696.desc=To make living solder for your UEV components or bio-circuits, you will need a chem plant with Rugged Botmium Casings. These are not easy to make!%n%nYou can certainly figure out the rest by now, but the Advanced Nitinol may confuse you. You make it out of blocks of Nitinol 60 with a Quantum Anomaly in a Laser Engraver. This means you need to make a UV Cyclotron, and hit several low chances in a row, so good luck with that!

# Quest.2697 - §5§lChlorine, Your New Best Friend
gtnh.quest2697.name=§5§lChlorine, Your New Best Friend
gtnh.quest2697.desc=Chlorine is a fluid that is used in significant quantities throughout the game, so you might as well get used to collecting it now.%n%nYou can electrolyse Salt, Rock Salt, Sodalite (finally a use!), or Salt Water for it. Since you'll need so much, you may wish to consider using your first Super Tank to hold it all.

# Quest.2698 - §1§b§l§1§2§3§4§5§4§6§7§8§9§a§b§c§d§e§c§b§lIo Trip
gtnh.quest2698.name=§1§b§l§1§2§3§4§5§4§6§7§8§9§a§b§c§d§e§c§b§lIo Trip
gtnh.quest2698.desc=Any ore veins not on Mercury are on this planet for this tier. The pyrolusite vein can have niobium extracted from it, and samarium can be acquired from mytryl and rubracium. Infused gold is also found here.%n%n§3Like Venus, you can collect firestone from small ore here.

# Quest.2699 - Play it Again, Sam
gtnh.quest2699.name=Play it Again, Sam
gtnh.quest2699.desc=So if you thought one Quantum Computer was cool, what about two? You can chain them to get more computing power for your research by connecting them with Optical Connectors the same way you connect to the Research Station. The original QC should have the slave to receive the data from the second one.%n%nOf course, this is kinda expensive, so there's actually another option, and that's to simply extend the first one. You can tear down the last two columns of blocks and then use an itemstack of two hologram projectors to see how a 4 computer rack one would be built. However, you'll need another UV or higher hatch to power it if you use 4 racks, since that will use 5A. You can do the same for up to a 12 stack for 24 computer racks if you want. Just add more of the middle slice, or let a larger stack of hologram projectors show you how it's done.%n%nIf you use 3 racks with 3 Crystalprocessor Mainframes and 1 Advanced Heat Vent each, you'll have enough for the UEV circuit, and it won't overheat either.%n%nA third option for higher computation needs is to finally go back and understand how the parametrizer works. With it you have a finer control over the maximum heat your QC reaches and get everything out of it.%n%nYou can also make the Parametrizer X now, but it's actually even more convoluted then the basic one and not recommended for the most part. Eventually you will unlock the Parametrizer tXt. With that you can finally just enter your parameters directly! %n%n%n§4Remember to let all the heat in your QCs dissipate before changing things.

# Quest.2700 - LSC = MC^2
gtnh.quest2700.name=LSC = MC^2
gtnh.quest2700.desc=This is the final upgrade to the LSC. You can use either the Ultimate or Really Ultimate batteries to craft it, it costs about the same either way.

# Quest.2701 - Chaotic Energy
gtnh.quest2701.name=Chaotic Energy
gtnh.quest2701.desc=Finally, Infinite RF! ...But what can I even use that for?

# Quest.2702 - Tier 7 Control Computer
gtnh.quest2702.name=Tier 7 Control Computer
gtnh.quest2702.desc=Each rocket needs a Control Computer, appropriate to the tier of the rocket.

# Quest.2703 - Extra Large Fuel Canisters
gtnh.quest2703.name=Extra Large Fuel Canisters
gtnh.quest2703.desc=Every rocket needs fuel storage canisters. For the tier 7 rocket you need to craft two large and two extra large canisters.

# Quest.2704 - Booster Tier 3
gtnh.quest2704.name=Booster Tier 3
gtnh.quest2704.desc=The distance you need to travel is much larger now, so the rocket needs bigger boosters to reach it.

# Quest.2705 - Heavy Duty Rocket Engine Tier 4
gtnh.quest2705.name=Heavy Duty Rocket Engine Tier 4
gtnh.quest2705.desc=Every rocket needs a rocket engine. A heavy one tier 3 is needed in the tier 5 rocket.

# Quest.2706 - Heavy Duty Rocket Fins Tier 4
gtnh.quest2706.name=Heavy Duty Rocket Fins Tier 4

# Quest.2709 - Booster Tier 4
gtnh.quest2709.name=Booster Tier 4
gtnh.quest2709.desc=The distance to other solar sytems is quite literally Astronomical, so you'll need even bigger boosters to reach them.

gtnh.quest2710.name=Tier 8 Control Computer
gtnh.quest2710.desc=Each rocket needs a Control Computer, appropriate to the tier of the rocket.

# Quest.2711 - Fluids for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2711.name=Fluids for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2711.desc=Ok, so let's say you've made some kind of culture, but you want more of it? You only need one per Vat, but they're consumed when making DNA Samples, so you should probably learn how.%n%nTo start off, you'll need to get an eColi Culture.%n%nUse that to make the eColi Bacteria Fluid.§3 (I know the name is completely different, deal with it)§r%n%nCentrifuge that to make Liquid DNA.%n%nAnd combine it with Radon in the Mixer to make FluorecentdDNA.%n%neColi Bacteria Fluid can also be Centrifuged for Plasma Membranes (10% chance) and EnzymesSollution, so do that as well.%n%nAnd then Centrifuge the EnzymesSollution again for Polymerase.%n%nYou should expect to need a significant amount of eColi Bacteria Fluid if you plan on copying a lot of cultures, or making the hard to make ones.%n%n§3To search for items related to copying cultures, search for 'culture', 'dna sample', or 'plasmid'. You can't do this for the Data Orbs, you have to check the uses of DNA Samples.%n%n§5A bunch of the fluids have incorrect spelling, don't blame me for it.

# Quest.2712 - DNA Samples for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2712.name=DNA Samples for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2712.desc=To copy cultures, you'll need to make a DNA sample first. Many of these have low chances, but this one's 100%. I'm sure you can figure it out yourself, but keep in mind that the Modules are not consumed, and that you may wish to use one of the IC2 Crops for the Detergent materials.

# Quest.2713 - Data Orbs for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2713.name=Data Orbs for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2713.desc=After getting your sample you need to encode the information to a Data Orb. Again, many times you'll have to do it repeatedly (the Data Orb is given back if it fails), but in this case it's 100%.%n%n§3Look at the uses of the eColi DNA Sample to see the recipe.

# Quest.2714 - Actually Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2714.name=Actually Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2714.desc=To copy a culture, you'll need%n1) A Sterilized Petri Dish%n2) A Plasma Membrane (made from Stemcells, or gotten while making EnzymesSollution)%n3) Stemcells%n4) A Data Orb with the appropriate data on it%n5) Liquid DNA%n6) A LuV Bio Lab%n7) A Clonal Cellular Synthesis Module%n%nYou can change out the Data Orb for one with whatever culture you wish to copy. Keep in mind that it might be easier to make a second culture the normal way, and that there's generally an alternative recipe that uses the fluid it produces to make it with a higher chance.%n%nPS: This recipe is the only one in NEI that uses this module, so you can find it if you look, but the number will change, so I can't specify which page.

# Quest.2715 - General Purpose Fermenting Bacteria
gtnh.quest2715.name=General Purpose Fermenting Bacteria
gtnh.quest2715.desc=So if you looked in NEI and tried to figure out how to make this, you were probably confused by the fact that you use the fluid it produces to make it. This is where NEI is lying to you. Like the previous recipe, NEI doesn't show it correctly (they should be around the same page in NEI, they both also appear to produce Sterilized Petri Dishes, (even if that's not true) and both use unique Modules).%n%nIn order to make this, you'll need to make the Rotten Flesh Bacteria culture, get the DNA Sample, and then get the Data Orb. It changes it's name to beta-Lactamase, that's normal.%n%nThen, do the same thing for Common Yeast (get the right Yeast!).%n%nThen you need to use the recipe to combine the information from the Data Orbs and get the Common Yeast Plasmid from that.%n%nLastly, use the Rotten Flesh Bacteria culture, the Common Yeast Plasmid, Penicillin (make it by centrifuging Common Yeast Fluid), and Distilled Water. You want the Transformation Module for this. It's a 100% chance.%n%nYou'll want to use the normal recipe to make more cultures, since it also becomes beta-Lactamase once you turn it into a DNA Sample.

# Quest.2716 - Longbow of the Heavens
gtnh.quest2716.name=Longbow of the Heavens
gtnh.quest2716.desc=Weak compared to both weapons of it's tier, and the weapons it's made of, this bow doesn't use arrows, never breaks, does 10 damage, and has an AoE of 10 more arrows that do 10 damage each fly down each time it strikes.

# Quest.2717 - Xenoxene Xenoxsis
gtnh.quest2717.name=Xenoxene Xenoxsis
gtnh.quest2717.desc=To make the next tier plastic, Radox, or the next tier of SMDs, you will need Xenoxene.%n%nGetting the the Xenoxene Xenoxsis culture is a bit tricky. The recipe is similar to the General Purpose one. Remember that all recipes in this chain are low probablility recipes.%n%nYour first step is to make the Barnardafis culture, then the DNA Sample, and then the Data Orb. If you didn't grab the saplings and dirt previously (to grow more trees for logs), head back to Barnarda C.%n%nUse the same recipe as for the General Purpose one, but use the Data Orb for Barnardafis instead of Common Yeast. You should get the Barnardafis Plasmid.%n%nAgain, it's the same recipe for the next step, but with the TCetiEis Fucus Serratus culture and the Barnardafis Plasmid, this should produce the Xenoxene Xenoxis culture. It's about a 4% chance.%n%nYou should probably use the normal alternative recipe to make more cultures, since it's easy to fail copying it too.%n%nYou should be able to figure out yourself how to make Xenoxene once you have the culture.%n%n%n§3After many years, the transformation recipe now even has NEI support!

# Quest.2720 - §2§lToo Many Leaves
gtnh.quest2720.name=§2§lToo Many Leaves
gtnh.quest2720.desc=Want to clear out shrubbery but don't want to pull out leaves by hand? Need to find that last log hidden in the middle of a bunch of leaves?%n%nTry an Iron Scythe! When used, it clears out a 5x5x5 area of leaves, crops, flowers, or grass. Excellent for tearing through Sacred Oak leaves or dense shrubbery in certain biomes. Later when you have a Cutting Machine you can upgrade to a Diamond Scythe with a 7x7x7 area of effect, or use Amethyst for 9x9x9 to FLEX.%n%n§3The lower tiers break leaves instantly, but don't seem to have the 3x3x3 range for some reason.

gtnh.quest2721.desc=You may have noticed that you can make more than just Charcoal in a Coke Oven, you can also make Coke. But which kinds are better?%n%nCoal (1600BT) + 1800t -> Coal Coke (3200BT) +500l Cr%nWood Log (300BT) + 1800t -> Charcoal (1600BT) + 250l Cr%nCactus (50BT) + 500t -> Cactus Charcoal (400BT) +30l Cr%nCactus Charcoal (400BT) + 500t -> Cactus Coke (800BT) +30l Cr%nSugar Cane (50BT) + 500t -> Sugar Charcoal (400BT) +30l Cr%nSugar Charcoal (400BT) + 500t -> Sugar Coke (800BT) +30l Cr%n%nYou'll want Coke for making steel in your BBF later on. Though you can still use charcoal if you want.

# Quest.2722 - §a§lWater, Fast
gtnh.quest2722.name=§a§lWater, Fast
gtnh.quest2722.desc=The Remote IO Water Reservoir works like the Everfull Urn in that you can pull water out as fast as you can pull it out, but you can use all the sides to do so.

# Quest.2729 - Genetically Modifying Your Plants
gtnh.quest2729.name=Genetically Modifying Your Plants
gtnh.quest2729.desc=There are 3 machines crucial to doing this. You'll also need bucketloads of power, and the same (literally) of UUM.%n%nAll 3 can only work on crops up to a certain tier, determined by the tier of the machine you made and the crop you're working with. Basically, it's (crop tier+2)/2, rounded up. So an LV machine can work on T1 crops, but an MV one can work on T3.%n%n§3LV=T1, MV=T3, HV=T5, EV=T7, IV=T9, LuV=T11, ZPM=T13, UV=T15, UHV=T17.§r%n%nFirst is the Crop Gene Extractor:%nIt takes an existing crop seedbag, an empty §2Data Orb§r (See EV quests), and §61A§r while running. Use a circuit to determine what stat to copy to the Data Orb. You'll probably want either 23-31-0, or 31-31-0 for max speed and output, since you won't be breeding from these. Remember to take proper precautions if going over 23, as they will attempt to weed everything around them. There's a significant number of crops, so you'll probably need a ton of Orbs too, unless you want to reuse them. §4Remember to keep a Data Orb or seedbag backup!§r%n%nSecond is the Crop Synthesizer:%nIt takes §24 Data Orbs§r, one for each of the types from the CGE, §51000L of UUM per crop tier/2§r (this is not rounded), and §616A§r while running. It will create a new crop seedbag with the desired stats.%n%nLastly is the Crop Replicator:%nIt takes an existing crop seedbag, §51000L per crop tier of UUM§r, and §66A§r while running. After finishing, it gives you back two of the same seedbag, duplicating it. This takes twice as much UUM, but less power, it's up to you whether that's worth it.

# Quest.2730 - Lasers Solve Everything
gtnh.quest2730.name=Lasers Solve Everything
gtnh.quest2730.desc=Laser hatches are a high-end way of sending lots of amps of power, so much in fact, that it starts at 32A. This goes 32/64/96/128/256+ and continues from there. They're also so powerful that only a few machines support them outside of the ever §owonderful§r TecTech: LSC, MEBF, MVF. and PSS. (Might be added in the future!) Remember to color both the Laser Vacuum Pipes, and the Source and Target Hatches. Also, Source = Output, Target = Input.%n%nLaser Converters are basically: Laser Source (on machine) -> Vacuum Pipes -> LC -> 5x output split into X amps, 32 for the first. Make sure to put it into recieve mode. Or do it the other way around if you want to go up, it's basically a transformer that converts laser to/from cables. You can also use them to turn the lasers if you don't mind 3x the loss on device output (and not sending all the amps) compared to the Active Transformer (because of loss on each output). Just remember to put a battery buffer in between if you want it to work.%n%n§3You can use the Low Power Laser Pipes if using a 'Low Power' Hatch or Converter, but keep in mind you'll need to connect them with wire cutters yourself after coloring them.%n%n§cBe careful with using very high ampere hatches as every Laser Hatch has 1EU/t per max. ampere passive power loss.

# Quest.2731 - Transform and...Stay Put Actually
gtnh.quest2731.name=Transform and...Stay Put Actually
gtnh.quest2731.desc=Active Transformers will transform power up or down at only a 0.004% power loss, making using several in a row obsolete, if you can afford it. Unfortunately, it's kinda expensive. On the other hand, you can use it to turn your lasers from your laser hatches, which is probably a better use.%n%nIt doesn't need a Maintenance Hatch, just the I/O Hatches.%n%n§4Be sure to turn off Power Pass if you want to edit your machine and don't want it to explode!

# Quest.2732 - §6§lThe Third Time's the Charm
gtnh.quest2732.name=§6§lThe Third Time's the Charm
gtnh.quest2732.desc=The Lapotronic Supercapacitor is an alternative to the Power Sub-Station (or Power Station Control Node as indicated on the controller) and the LESU. It is harder to make, but has its own benefits:%n%n1) It looks cooler%n2) Hatch tier is not limited by the capacitors like cells, so you can use whatever hatch tier you want if you store up power or have the input for it%n3) Can mix and match Capacitor tiers%n4) Loses 1% of total capacity every 24h, so much much less, but you can't cheese it%n5) Actually stores way more power at IV+ tier%n%nIt also has downsides of course:%n1) More expensive to make%n2) Stores less power, though this is only the case with EV%n3) Can only I/O on the bottom 2 layers%n4) Can't cheese power loss%n5) It can have maintenance issues, unlike the PSS, voiding 20% more power per, so try not to let that slide. Though at most it's still only 2.2%%n%nFor the first, smallest one, you'll need the following, plus an Energy Hatch and a Dynamo (or the laser equivalents). Remember that you can get your Lapos back if you run the capacitor through an unpackager. Finally a reason to make one!%n%nYou can use Laser Hatches, that can output very high amperage. You need at least UV Glass to use them. (This is also the case with PSS BTW.)%n%nBTW your LSC can hold between 540M and 8.1B EU using only the EV capacitors. Remember that you need more than half the blocks to be non-empty capacitors for it to be valid.

# Quest.2733 - §6§lLapotronic Capacitor (LuV)
gtnh.quest2733.name=§6§lLapotronic Capacitor (LuV)
gtnh.quest2733.desc=It holds more than the previous tier, other than that there is no difference. Your LSC can hold between 9B and 135B EU with these.

# Quest.2734 - §6§lLapotronic Capacitor (ZPM)
gtnh.quest2734.name=§6§lLapotronic Capacitor (ZPM)
gtnh.quest2734.desc=It holds more than the previous tier, other than that there is no difference. Your LSC can hold between 90B and 1.35T EU with these.%n%n§3Requires EV-tier Glass.

# Quest.2735 - §6§lLapotronic Capacitor (UV)
gtnh.quest2735.name=§6§lLapotronic Capacitor (UV)
gtnh.quest2735.desc=It holds more than the previous tier, other than that there is no difference. Your LSC can hold between 900B and 13.5T EU with these.%n%n§3Requires IV-tier Glass.%n%n§3PS: The last tier is on the Engame Goals tab.

# Quest.2736 - §6§lHangover From All That Glue?
gtnh.quest2736.name=§6§lHangover From All That Glue?
gtnh.quest2736.desc=Surface-mount devices are more advanced circuits parts. They're needed for the EV tier+ circuit line and are cheaper to craft than the basic versions, if you have the right materials. You need an MV Assembler and some molten polyethylene. For now, resistors are probably the only ones you can make with any ease.

# Quest.2737 - §2§lMore Food, More Hearts
gtnh.quest2737.name=§2§lMore Food, More Hearts
gtnh.quest2737.desc=So, food is great, right? But what's even greater is eating tons of it! Too boring and pointless you say? Well, what if I told you you can get extra hearts just by expanding your palate. You get 1 point for every half shank of hunger from a food eaten, and after 50 points, you get 1 extra heart! Now you have a reason to make all those Pam's foods. Of course, each food only contributes it's shank value once, no cheating!%n%nIf you want to see what foods you've eaten, you can use the (not) handy Food Journal. Realistically though, you'll want to use NEI to both see foods eaten and not eaten. You can search for 'not yet eaten' to see foods left, and 'assisted' to see foods eaten. You need to have started diminishing returns first to see this.%n%n§3If it doesn't work for you, try the following. First, go to NEI options in the bottom left when the inventory is open, then click on inventory, and change Search Mode to Regex. Then restart your client, and try searching again.§r%n%nThere are also two commands:%n%n/foodlist size%nWill tell you total progress, and progress to next heart.%n%n/foodlist sync <PlayerName>%nIs to sync with the server if it gets out of sync.

# Quest.2753 - Basic AE2 System
gtnh.quest2753.name=Basic AE2 System
gtnh.quest2753.desc=So you've unlocked AE2, but don't know how to use it? Not to worry, that's what this questline is for. For a basic (and not completely useless) ME system, make the items on the right first. After you go through the quests to get them normally of course.%n%n§3You could technically make one with an ME Chest, but there'd be no advantage over using a regular chest.§r%n%nConnect power to the Energy Acceptor, place the ME Drive next to it, place a Fluix Cable on top of the ME Drive connect the ME Terminal to the cable. Just put in the Storage cells, and you're done! Remember you need a Network Tool to see how much power it actually uses. Also, it lets you pick up stuff easier.%n%nTo save power, let's do a little extra work. Place the Pressure Plate two spaces in front of the ME Terminal, place redstone next to it and beside the Energy Acceptor. Remove the EA and place a Fluix Cable there, and then place the ME Toggle Bus between the Drive and where the Energy Acceptor will be. Then plunk that back down and re-power it. This will cause it to only connect (and thus use power) when you stand on the plate. This tiny network uses about 38 EU by itself, so you should understand that an ME system is not cheap either in materials or power.

# Quest.2754 - External Storage
gtnh.quest2754.name=External Storage
gtnh.quest2754.desc=Drawers are great, right? Well, let's connect your ME system to a bank of them. Set up some drawers nearby with a controller attached. Then place an ME Storage Bus against the controller and set the priority to +1. This will prioritize I/O to the drawer controller. Lock your drawers before they fill with random stuff. Now you have access to the whole thing! Great for the results of mining, and anything else you have thousands of, while keeping your ME system relatively empty.%n%nYou can also connect to chests and other things if you want. You can use an Ender Chest to send stuff into your network, which will then send it to the drawers, but you'll have stuff entering and exiting constantly, so it'll mess up your view in the Terminal. You can use filtered view cells, or process them before they go into your ME network (or in a different one) and/or send them to the DC directly via another EC. It depends on what you want to do and what it is.%n%n§4Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will tank TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.

# Quest.2755 - Autocrafting
gtnh.quest2755.name=Autocrafting
gtnh.quest2755.desc=This is the main purpose of AE2, so let's get to it. Plunk down the Crafting Storage and Molecular Assembler, connect the Pattern Terminal to a cable, and attach the ME Interface to the MA (make sure it has power from another side). You could run it without a ME Interface, but you can only do one recipe then. Place a Blank Pattern in the Pattern Terminal, and add the recipe for a Crafting Table, then click the arrow to save it to the pattern. Put this in the ME Interface and you can now request a craft of it. (if the items are in the network, otherwise it'll fail obviously)%n%nFor processing patterns (machines, anything not regular 3x3 crafting) click the button on the right. You'll need to specify all I/O for it yourself. You can use this on an ME Interface on a furnace (for example), combined with an ME Import Bus to collect the results. If it's a machine that auto-ejects (like multis) you can use a ME Interface to collect the results much faster (and with less lag).

# Quest.2756 - P2P
gtnh.quest2756.name=P2P
gtnh.quest2756.desc=One of the more complicated parts of AE2, you'll need to understand this to really get anywhere with the mod. First, replace your EA with an ME Controller. Now you have a bunch more channels to work with. Place the P2P Bus against one of the sides and then connect some cables to it to a place a bit away. Make sure to send power to this cable with an EA or Quartz Fiber, but NOT a normal cable, this is now a separate network, and that would cancel that. Connect the second P2P Bus to the other end, and then place at least 1 Dense Cable coming off of it. Shift-right click your 1st P2P Bus, then Right click the 2nd. They're now connected, and there are 2 channels being used on your subnetwork, while you have the full 32 from the side of your Controller to use. For each subnetwork that doesn't have an ME Controller, you can send 4 sides, or 128 channels. I'm sure you can understand how useful this is, right?%n%nThere's lots more to understand about AE2, but you should probably either experiment, read the quests, or watch a video for more than the basics.%n%nAlso keep in mind that EC2 is kinda completely broken in regards to fluids, so maybe avoid that. (The questmaker is sad :()

# Quest.2757 - Cool Guys Don't Look at Explosions

gtnh.quest2760.desc=In addition to being a dehydrator multi, it's also a Vacuum Furnace, for which no singleblock exists. It's supposed to be used with the IsaMill Grinding Machine multi and the Flotation Cell Regulator multi for the purposes of ore milling, an advanced method of ore processing that needs a lot of infrastructure, but which gives many new outputs for each ore it supports.%n%n§3This multi is ZPM.

# Quest.2761 - Do I Really Need to Make This?
gtnh.quest2761.name=Do I Really Need to Make This?
gtnh.quest2761.desc=Oh wait, yes, you actually need this now! That was supposed to be a rhetorical question!%n%nThe main thing you will probably get out of it is the Quantum Anomaly for Advanced Nitinol.%n%n§3This multi is LuV. But you don't need it until around UHV.

# Quest.2762 - This is Not How You Get Into Space
gtnh.quest2762.name=This is Not How You Get Into Space
gtnh.quest2762.desc=This produces power out of Rocket Fuels. To see how to make them, look at the Space Race tab. These are specifically GT++ Rocket Fuels, and automating them for powergen in this multi will also provide you with endless fuel for your space travels.%n%nThe math regarding the Rocketdyne is complicated. Looking at the controller's tooltip helps, but the main gist of it is like this: provide Carbon Dioxide and make sure it doesn't run out, choose the EU/t you want to get, calculate the amount of fuel you need for the fuel you will use, and then provide enough Liquid Hydrogen to boost the multi, according to the EU/t value.%n%nYou will always want to have the Rocketdyne boosted, for several reasons. Assuming you have at least a buffered IV Dynamo Hatch, outputting close to the maximum on that hatch will lower the fuel efficiency, but not if it's boosted. Additionally, this multi doesn't consume fuel continuously, but with intervals of 1 second between consuming and not consuming, while generating power all the same. Boosting this consumption results in huge fuel efficiency, combined with the high fuel values of the Rocket Fuels.%n%n§3This multi is IV.

# Quest.2763 - §6§lI Put a Machine Into Your Machine
gtnh.quest2763.name=§6§lI Put a Machine Into Your Machine
gtnh.quest2763.desc=Effectively lets you parallel like crazy if you can afford the power. 1 EV hatch can supply all 64 possible machines if they're LV. You can also separate busses with a screwdriver. The PA is usually less efficient than a dedicated multiblock but it is very versatile and allows for TecTech energy hatches and even laser hatches once you get there.%n%n§3Doesn't work with some machines, like mass fabs.%n%nJust in case you get that far and still remember it: The PA maxes out at UHV recipes. But UEV machines are treated as 4x UHV machines giving you a lot of parallels.%n%nThere is also a new experimental feature where the PA can handle fluid recipes without cells but using the fluid directly.

# Quest.2764 - A Steam Tier Multi? Unpossible!
gtnh.quest2764.name=A Steam Tier Multi? Unpossible!
gtnh.quest2764.desc=It's a larger version of the steam macerator. It only works 8 at a time, but is faster.%n%nNote that this multi requires §4§lVery Specific§r I/O blocks, don't mess it up.%n%n

# Quest.2765 - §6§lTFFT
gtnh.quest2765.name=§6§lTFFT
gtnh.quest2765.desc=The TFFT is very useful if you don't want to have a bunch of Super Tanks with overflow covers on buffer ULV Tanks.%n%nWith the tier I storage field block, it consumes 31.5 EU/t but only has about 0.315x the storage capacity of a ST I per fluid.%n%nWith the tier V storage field block it consumes 504 EU/t and has about 1.26x the storage capacity of a QT III per fluid.%n%nYou can use the multi hatch to access all the fluids at once with an ME Fluid Storage Bus or Fluid Ender Conduit.%n%nYou need 63 of any tier of storage field block, you can mix them too.%n%n§3Remember to turn auto-voiding on.

# Quest.2766 - Deep Earth Heating Pump
gtnh.quest2766.name=Deep Earth Heating Pump
gtnh.quest2766.desc=This allows you to skip the Fluid Reactor part of a FR setup, by heating the coolant with geothermal energy.%n%nIt's basically free power, but so is using an everburn urn with the LHE, so whatever. This is insanely expensive, so keep that in mind!

# Quest.2767 - Get it Together Bees!
gtnh.quest2767.name=Get it Together Bees!
gtnh.quest2767.desc=These frames help prevent genetic decay.

# Quest.2768 - Bee Slurry, the Breakfast of, Well, Weirdos
gtnh.quest2768.name=Bee Slurry, the Breakfast of, Well, Weirdos
gtnh.quest2768.desc=Why would you even need this?

# Quest.2769 - Even More Stats
gtnh.quest2769.name=Even More Stats
gtnh.quest2769.desc=There's seven more stats to worry about too.%n%n§7Fertilizer§r, §9Water§r, and §4Weed-EX§r are all about how much of these is on the crop stick rather than the crop itself. They're all about how much was applied, and is left of that.%n%n§2Nutrients§r, §1Humidity§r, and §6Air Quality§r are all about the environment. They're also affected by the Fertilizer and Water stats.%n%nNutrients and Humidity are mostly about the right biome, with swamp and rainforest types (hot+humid) being the best, but you can also get some extra stats by setting up right.%n%n§2Nutrients§r:%n3 possible free points from dirt under the farmland block, 2 for plants that require a specific block. So optimally always make sure that the required block is at the bottommost bottom in the column, because it checks in chain, not certain height. For example: cropstick -> farmland -> dirt -> oreblock -> dirt, it will only register 1 dirt, ignoring the one below the oreblock.%n%n5-10 possible points from fertilizing your crops. You can use fertilizer on a crop to increase its nutrients stat. Fertilizer caps at 199 which gives 10 nutrients, but can be applied again only if the crop drops below 100 fertilizer points. So for high stat crops its safe to assume and make tests for 100 fertilizer points as its a given constant unlike 199->100 values. You can apply bonemeal, IC2 fertilizer and Forestry fertilizer to a crop by hand. Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron does this automatically when supplied with fertilizer (the multifarm needs fertilizer to harvest crops as well).%n%n§1Humidity§r:%n2 free points from using dirt as farmland, as when farmland gets hydrated by water(turns darker) it gains 2 humidity points. This is why other blocks for this suck, since they don't give this bonus.%n%n10 possible points from hydrating your crop. Similiar to fertilizing, water can be applied to crop up to 200 points, which is 10 humidity points, altough unlike fertilizer it does not need to drop below value of 100, water can be applied over and over keeping it at constant 200 points. You can apply water to your crop by using IC2 hydration cells by hand, or let your Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron do it automatically. The multifarm needs water to harvest crops as well though.%n%n§6Air Quality§r:%n4 potential free points from empty space around crop. A crop checks for empty spaces to calculate bonus air quality points, it gives up to 4 points, 1 point for each 2 empty spaces. It only counts full blocks or cropsticks though. If you like looks, you'll probably have to sacrifice this.%n%n4 free points from height of your farm. You get 1 free point every 15 blocks startng at Y79.%n79 - 1 point%n94 - 2 points%n109 - 3 points%n124 - 4 points%n%n2 free points from no opaque blocks above the crop. You can place glass above and you won't lose the bonus since it's a transparent block. You cannot use dark glass, several layers of water, or gaseous tenebrae to get around this if your crop likes the dark. Unless you only let it grow at night I guess§..%n%n§aGrowability§r:%nYour crop will require a certain level of NHA, try to reach or surpass this, or the crop will either not grow, or even die (disappear). Each crop is different, and higher tiers (and stats) require more. It's generally easy to meet though, as long as you're in a good biome.%n%nGrowability is determined by the difference between what the crop needs in terms of NHA, and what it actually has. If you have more than what you need it grows faster. This is why you don't want a maxed resistance stat, since higher stats will slow it down.

# Quest.2770 - Min-Maxing Crops
gtnh.quest2770.name=Min-Maxing Crops
gtnh.quest2770.desc=Breed stickreed until it's around 20/31/10, then create other crops with it, they inherit the stats. Crossbreeding with the ones you got on the way to raise their stats is also good.%n%nSetup camp in a swamp/jungle type biome around Y130, or use the biome changing methods to make one. This is way faster when breeding crops, not just growing them for drops.%n%nUse multifarms, always. You can use them together with the harvesters if you have super fast crops. Or just use more farms. Or add more gearboxes.%n%nDark glass is nice for oreberry crops.%n%nTo avoid weeding, checkerboard up and down on your multifarm. It may look stupid, but no weeds, Gr 23->31, and +2 AQ!%n%nUse fertilia to create more fertilizer.%n%nYou can replace mob farms with crops if you don't care about the other drops. Infernals drop special stuff though.%n%nUse WAs in TE mode to accelerate crops if you need it. Mostly useful for breeding, statting up, and for the primordial berry crop.%n%nAs you tier up, you can create 31/31/0 crops with the machines and UUM. It's up to you whether it's worth it though.%n%nGo do bees if you want something higher than EV tier materials.

# Quest.2771 - U-238 Tu-Wait, Seriously?
gtnh.quest2771.name=U-238 Tu-Wait, Seriously?
gtnh.quest2771.desc=If you want IC2 crops to work with the multifarm, you now need this. Get the U-238 from thorium, and the endereyes from either your crops, villagers, or the normal way in HV. It also only searches 6 blocks above the farm structure block to prevent lag. So goodbye MF stacking, you always looked dumb, and didn't make any sense.%n%nThe largest size supports ~1100 crops, while the smallest supports ~600 depending on your layout if you use it for IC2 crops. This is because it will look for crops up to 5 blocks out further than normal in this mode (In the cardinal directions, it's further out in the corners. Just try it out, it's hard to describe). They're the same size as in previous versions, so you don't need to rejigger them.%n

# Quest.2772 - BEGONE, LAG! Also, Bats
gtnh.quest2772.name=BEGONE, LAG! Also, Bats
gtnh.quest2772.desc=Lag = Butterflies in this case, since they like to pile up just outside of chunk loading range. Also, they're annoying since they convert regular trees into more forestry ones, one leaf block at a time. Which causes more of the buggers to spawn. Fortunately, the settings we use prevent too many from being present at once, but still, they're annoying.%n%nThe solution to this is to kill them. Also, the bats. Stupid Thaumcraft warp. Use the (potentially unfinished) Pest Killer to do so.%n%nNotes: Hydrogen Cyanide has a recipe now. Both it and Formaldehyde require a Chemical Plant. It doesn't appear to use any of the Formaldehyde up though. The range is apparently 5x5 chunks, not blocks. It also only runs once every 30s or so?%n%n§3PS: If you experience problems using it (more than already mentioned), raise a ticket on github.

# Quest.2773 - Purge...Some of Your Warp?
gtnh.quest2773.name=Purge...Some of Your Warp?
gtnh.quest2773.desc=They're a pain to make, and only work if you have 50+ warp, but if you're wondering if you have dementia from all the chest scrambling, they may be for you. Check the warp theory tab in the thaumonomicon for this and the related items.

# Quest.2779 - Pocket Plasma EV
gtnh.quest2779.name=Pocket Plasma EV
gtnh.quest2779.desc=Assuming you don't want to setup something crazy every time you move your miners, you'll need some kind of SB to power them. This is one of the good options. You can just teleport the fuel instead.%n%n§3You may note that the efficiency goes §oup§3 rather than down as it goes up in tiers. Enjoy this small comfort, the multis are still way better.

gtnh.quest2785.desc=This is the LuV version. It has 60% efficiency, and produces 750 to 6000 pollution/s.

# Quest.2786 - How Many Forests Did You Cut Down to Power This?
gtnh.quest2786.name=How Many Forests Did You Cut Down to Power This?
gtnh.quest2786.desc=This is the HV version, with the lowest efficiency so far of 85%. You can offset that by just generating more Benzene, alongside Phenol and Toluene in a Distillation Tower, or use Naphtha instead... You have many options at this point, surely enough to fight the increasing power demands of your automation.%n%nBenzene doesn't get upgraded in HV, only in EV. You'll be able to make Nitrobenzene when you're there, and burn it in some turbines bigger than this one.

# Quest.2787 - Even Better Diesel
gtnh.quest2787.name=Even Better Diesel
gtnh.quest2787.desc=In HV, you unlock yet another generator, but also Cetane-Boosted Diesel. After a bunch of reactions, you can get a superpowered combustion fuel that is worth §a1M EU per bucket§a§r and run it for quite a while on these improved generators. You will also unlock the Distillation Tower here, so you might get even more fuel that you can burn in these generators.%n%nUnfortunately, the next fuel, unlocked in EV, doesn't come from Diesel. It's a completely different processing line, should you wish to tackle it later.

# Quest.2788 - Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators LV
gtnh.quest2788.name=Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators LV
gtnh.quest2788.desc=You've probably collected a ton of Creosote and have little to use it on. To fix that, build a Semifluid Generator and use it alongside Steam as a secondary power source! Singleblock generators will only use fuel if there is EU demand, so you might end up with a filled Creosote buffer if you aren't consuming enough EU.%n%nTo extract the Creosote from your Coke Ovens, you can use buckets or cells to do it by hand, or the TiCon Faucet into GT fluid pipes, or an Electric Pump cover from You're Going to Hate This #2.%n%nThere are other options to burn Creosote, like the Railcraft Liquid Boilers, but this is much cheaper and easier to set up, while still being efficient with Creosote (6x as efficient as Combustion Generators).

# Quest.2789 - Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators MV
gtnh.quest2789.name=Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators MV
gtnh.quest2789.desc=If you're still burning Creosote for power, you can get MV amps out of it with these machines. It won't last long, and definitely isn't a good main power source, but it'll give you some EU for your trouble.%n%nAlternatively, Heavy Fuel? It has the same EU per bucket as Benzene, 360k, and is the only semifluid with more than 100k per bucket. If you have it, and are not consuming enough for Diesel, you can use it this way.

# Quest.2790 - Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators HV
gtnh.quest2790.name=Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators HV
gtnh.quest2790.desc=If you've built Distillation Towers to improve your Oil or Benzene processing line, you might have ended up with some extra fuels that are semifluids, such as Heavy Fuel or Creosote. If you've accumulated them so much that they've started voiding, you can instead make an HV Semifluid Generator and get free power out of them!%n%nThe Creosote from one DT that is processing Wood Tar is enough to power the DT itself, depending on the fuel efficiency. One HV generator is just enough to power it.

# Quest.2791 - You Haven't Learned How to Separate Fluids Yet? Seriously?
gtnh.quest2791.name=You Haven't Learned How to Separate Fluids Yet? Seriously?
gtnh.quest2791.desc=This multi follows the same logic as the Large Combustion Engine, but it uses semifluids instead. If you have the need to burn any of those for power, like Heavy Fuel for example, you can put this together.%n%n§3Check the Large Combustion Engine quest for more details.

# Quest.2792 - Acid Trip
gtnh.quest2792.name=Acid Trip
gtnh.quest2792.desc=This is the HV version. Will people really use this? Each stack of Redstone Dust is worth around 580k EU, so look at your storage and see what you have.

# Quest.2793 - Hallucinogenics Not Included
gtnh.quest2793.name=Hallucinogenics Not Included
gtnh.quest2793.desc=This is the EV version. I hope you're not using this for primary power gen? At least, it has a pretty good efficiency of 88% for an EV singleblock, and it's better than voiding the fluids that can be used as fuel here.

# Quest.2794 - Portable Clean Energy EV
gtnh.quest2794.name=Portable Clean Energy EV
gtnh.quest2794.desc=As long as you don't hold the fuel, that is. Very useful for your Mining rigs, the efficiency on these goes way up as they increase in tier. Though they require more Enriched Naquadah each tier (and Naquadria at ZPM).%n%n§3The fuel is radioactive, dummy.

# Quest.2798 - Geothermal Power EV
gtnh.quest2798.name=Geothermal Power EV
gtnh.quest2798.desc=Turns lava into power, at very inefficient rates. Also, seems to produce way more pollution than it says. They also require you to be 2 tiers above the output amount, so, yeah.%n%n§3Wasn't geothermal supposed to be environmentally friendly?

# Quest.2826 - Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Mk II
gtnh.quest2826.name=Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Mk II
gtnh.quest2826.desc=It's the same as the previous, but more/better. It takes less time to heat up, but it chews through fuel pretty fast too. It still isn't as good as an LGT for power produced over time, but it can produce power faster. As long as you use it with the HP Steam Turbine.%n%nIt can produce 1A+ of LuV if you set it up right.

# Quest.2827 - Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Mk I
gtnh.quest2827.name=Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Mk I
gtnh.quest2827.desc=It uses Gas fuels to produce power and Steam at the same time, while also generating 0 pollution. If the other generators were being problematic, this is the best solution.%n%nIt produces §a4 HV amps per tick§r at a nice fuel efficiency, while consuming 100 L of Oxygen per second. It will heat up over time until it reaches 100% efficiency, at which point it starts outputting Steam as well. You can then use Steam Turbines, singleblocks or multiblocks, to generate even more power.%n%nWith these two things combined, it's more powerful than the Large Gas Turbine that you can build at the start. Only when you unlock better materials for that, will it generate more power than the SOFC Mk I.

# Quest.2828 - It's 'Super' Heated Steam
gtnh.quest2828.name=It's 'Super' Heated Steam
gtnh.quest2828.desc=So that means it produces §otwice§r as much power! You can get this steam through the LHE, the SOFC Mk II or the Titanium/Tungstensteel Boilers. It gets converted to normal steam as the output at a 1:1 ratio, so make sure to have a non-HP one to take advantage of that. In total, a HP Steam Turbine and a regular one combined produce 3x the EU with Superheated Steam that normal Steam would produce.

gtnh.quest2829.desc=Fluid Nukes, Vac Nukes and Wrench Reactors (lol), are more advanced versions of the normal one.%n%nFluid means you build it differently (with the parts on the right, it's a 5x5 cube surrounding the normal one), with the goal of producing as much hot coolant (cycle in non-hot) as possible, to use that to produce power. It doesn't produce power on it's own, but more overall. Send it to the LHE to get SH steam out of it, then go through a HP steam turbine, then a normal steam turbine.%n%nVac nukes remove heat by sending it to coolant cells instead of coolant. Any cell in a cardinal direction will receive the heat instead of the reactor. Use a vacuum freezer to restore the Helium/NaK cells' durability.%n%nWrench reactors are when you fill the reacor with fuel rods, turn it on, and wrench it to reset it's heat state before it explodes. If you can automate it, you deserve a medal!%n%nIf you still don't know what a MOX one is, it produces more power the higher the temperature, so you try to keep it heat neutral, and as hot as possible. Of course, this can cause things nearby to, well, §omelt.§r You use MOX or Naquadria fuel cells work for this. You can also get more Plutonium out of MOX than Uranium.%n%nA breeder reactor is when you setup a reactor to get an item out of it rather than power, like Lutetium from Thorium, Plutonium from MOX, etc. Look at the depleted x fuel rod list in NEI or on the wiki to see more.%n%n§3Since Fluid Nukes are liable to explode if you run out of coolant, make sure you setup a cutoff tied to the temperature or amount of coolant with redstone.

gtnh.quest2830.desc=You'll need this to increase the power to your multis and progress.%n%nYou need some Vanadium-Gallium to make HPIC Wafers for it, and an IV Cutting Machine if you haven't made the multi.%n%n§3I hope you had fun with the platline, lol.

# Quest.2831 - Covering Up
gtnh.quest2831.name=Covering Up
gtnh.quest2831.desc=This quest goes over all of the covers, just in case you forgot or they weren't mentioned. If they have their own quest, look at it for more info. You can put them on basically any GT block, pipe, machine, tank, etc. Though that doesn't consider whether it will work right or be useful. Shift-Right-Click will open a GUI for many of them. For covers that you can adjust the amount of, clicking the left side with a screwdriver goes down, and right goes up. All covers block rain on the side they're attached to. Generally you can adjust covers with a screwdriver, whether they have a GUI or not. You can remove them with a crowbar if you forgot.%n%n§9§lFluid-Related Covers:§r%nPump: Transfers fluids at the speed specified on the tooltip.%n%nFluid Regulator: Regulates the rate that fluid can go through it, as well as pumping it. Can work x/s or x/t.%n%nSteam Valve: Moves more, but is only for steam. Only goes to IV. Does not work on SH steam.%n%nOverflow: Voids anything over the specified amount in the tank.%n%nFluid Detector: Will emit RS based on fluid fill rate of the tank it's on. By default, empty=15, full=0. Use inverted mode to swap. Useful on tanks and hatches.%n%nEnder Fluid Link: Cover version of ender tanks to TP fluid around. Doesn't connect to ender tanks though.%n%nDrain Module: Protects from rain on that side, and will fill the tank with water from rain if it can. Useless.%n%nFluid Filter: Filters fluid going through it. Click with a cell to set it.%n%nShutter: Blocks items/fluids when active. Use it with a machine controller and RS. Does not visually disconnect/block. You place it between the pipes, and put the MC on the same pipe.%n%n§2§lItem-Related Covers:§r%nConveyor: Sends items. Use an item pipe in import mode or on a GT block/machine.%n%nRobot Arm: Sends from a specific slot in the machine it's on (internal) to another specific slot in a block next to it (adjacent). Keep going through numbers until you get it right, it seems to change per machine. If the output slot is full, it won't output. There need to be a valid block with slots to send to or the settings won't save.%n%nItem Detector: Will emit RS based on item fill rate of the block it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Detects by filled slots, so doesn't work right with the super/quantum chests. Probably better for busses.%n%nItem Filter: WIP PR.%n%n§6§lEU-Related Covers:§r%nEnergy Detector: Will emit RS based on EU fill rate of the batbuff/tank it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Make sure to set it to include batteries. Can also detect steam for some reason.%n%nPower Pass Upgrade: Read the tooltip, then ask Bart how it works, he didn't bother telling anyone. He'll probably just tell you the code is the best documentation, just like the Tectech guys. May not actually be finished/work, either.%n%nTesla Coil/Tesla Coil Rich Edition: Use with the tesla tower to send EU wirelessly or something. %n%n§d§lOther Covers:§r%nPlayer Detector: Detects players. About 10 block range. §4Currently owner/other is inverted on non-pipes due to some bug or another.§r%n%nActivity Detector: Detects either recipe progress or idleness. 0%=0 RS, ~95%=14 by default. In idle mode, idleness is 15, and is 0 when running by default.%n%nMachine Controller: Turns machine on/off based on RS. Disable machine will keep it off regardless of RS state. Safe Mode only works on MBs. If a MB runs out of power, it will normally turn off, but a MC will turn it back on, continuing to void stuff. This will set it to the disable machine state instead. You will also get a notification. §4Safe mode is currently broken?§r%n%nNeeds Maintenance: Emits RS if it meets the condition specified. Rotor=turbine?%n%nRedstone Transmitter/Receiver (In/Out): OK, these things are confusing, so listen closely. First, set a frequency, either by using the GUI, or using the original way: right clicking it with an item. Empty hand = 0, other items = their item ID. Be careful not to reset it to 0 by accident. Honestly, just use the GUI. You can set it to private or not, it's the same kind of thing as EnderStorage, so you don't blare RS across the server. Channel state = RS level.%n%nRT(O) sets the channel state based on the redstone level sent from outside to the specific side. You can TP a RS from this to the RR(O).%nRT(I) sets the channel state based on redstone level that would be emitted from the machine itself. §4Always sends 15, so it's useless.§r%nRR(O) outputs redstone level based on channel state. You can TP RS from the RT(O) to here.%nRR(I) controls whether a machine can work based on channel state, just like a machine controller cover does. If it has 0 RS, it stays off. At least 1, and it turns on. You send the signal from elsewhere with the RT(O).%nRR(I) can also be used in conjunction with other covers whose states talk about conditional.%n%nIC2 Heat vents: Speeds up machines a tiny amount? Someone look through the code and tell me what it means. Also looks neat.%n%nCrafting Table: Adds a crafting table to the block you can use. Useless.%n%nPlanks/Plates/Foils: Blocks I/O on that side. Use a screwdriver to set allowed types of stuff through. Blocks everything by default. Set the output to another side first to avoid changing its settings too. You'll probably 'use' this by accident at least once.%n%nComputer Monitor: Adds a visual look. Useless, but sorta fancy.%n%nLens: Visual only. Useless.

The higher tier ones charge faster (advanced solars just point at the sun to get 100% power during daylight instead of only at noonish, but hybrids are indeed faster. Also hybrids don't crash the game just by placing them anymore!)

# Quest.2849 - §5§lFaster Steam Transportation
gtnh.quest2849.name=§5§lFaster Steam Transportation
gtnh.quest2849.desc=Do you think that steam fluid transport is far too slow? Your LV pumps got you down, doing only 640L/s? Then it's time to make the 32 times faster LV steam valves!%n%nThey only work with steam and are just as fast as the valve on a Railcraft tank (if you put it on the bottom side).%n%n§6§4§3There's also MV, HV, EV and IV versions.

# Quest.2850 - §5§lLong Distance Item Pipeline
gtnh.quest2850.name=§5§lLong Distance Item Pipeline
gtnh.quest2850.desc=Wouldn't it be great if you could transport ores from a far away ore vein by pipes to your base?%n%nThis is not a problem anymore. Connect your setup on the start and end point with a Long Distance Item Pipeline block. Inbetween use the associated pipe blocks - the total distance between endpoints must be more than 64 blocks apart (4 or more chunks). There can only be one start and end point per pipeline.%n%nTo actually connect it, you need to align the start LDIP block such that the arrows are facing inwards, and the opposite side of it has a LDIPP block. Put a conveyor on the side of the block that has the arrows and set to import. It will now attempt to import stuff to the endpoint LDIP. §2This will go as fast as you can put items into it.§r%n%nDo the opposite on the far side, except you don't need a conveyor.%n%nNow you only need to chunkload the start and end points and the items will be "teleported" to you.%n%nOf course, later on you'll probably use ender chests to §oactually§r teleport the ore, especially from other dims.%n%nThis setup is lag-free in the pipe blocks, so it's useful in your base as well if you want to reduce lag.

# Quest.2856 - §6§lAdvanced MB Construction
gtnh.quest2856.name=§6§lAdvanced MB Construction
gtnh.quest2856.desc=The ability to rotate MBs and view a structure hologram has been sto-§oborrowed§r from §9Tec§1Tech§r, giving you greater freedom to build the way you want! §5(until we nerf wallsharing at least)§r%n%nUnlike TT, you can use a normal wrench for this, just aim at the front center of a controller (or one of the other sides if you want to. You just need to aim for the part of the grid with the mark) and right click or shift-right-click. The first rotates it clockwise, the latter flips it. If you want to change the facing of the controller itself, do that the normal way.%n%nUse a Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector or MSHP to visualize the structure, pay attention to the bottom left for structure details. For multiblocks that accept multiple types of tiered components or have a variable size, the number of MSHPs you hold in your hand will decide which tier is shown in the hologram.%n%n§3If you don't get it, try placing a controller, wrenching it, and using the MSHP on it.§r%n%nWhile it's now possible to build a sideways EBF, or even build one into the floor, not everything can be rotated. Exceptions include: LSC, Charcoal Pile Igniter, BBF, DT, Miners, Industial Washing Plant, Algae Farm, Bacterial Vat, DEHP, the MVF can, but the MBF cannot.%n%n§3PS: We did get permission, that was just a little joke.

gtnh.quest2858.desc=Thanks to the tireless work of the devs, you can now use cells to I/O fluids directly from the interface of GT machines. Just click on the fluid while holding a cell or other fluid container item.%n%nPoints to consider:%n1) Left click to attempt filling/emptying all fluid containers held on cursor.%n2) Right click to attempt filling/emptying one fluid container held on cursor.%n3) All fluid containers that can be used in a standard gt tank (e.g. super tanks or the X voltage tanks) are supported, including but not limited to: water bottles, vanilla buckets, ic2 (universal and normal) cells, volumetric flasks, large fluid cells, pressurized fluid tanks, etc.%n4) Can fill/take less than one cell (1000L or 144L if molten) of fluid if the fluid container supports doing so.%n5) It won't check if it's a valid fluid for the machine/recipe, keep that in mind.%n6) Doesn't work with Crops++ alcohols, feel free to code compatibility for us.%n7) EIO tanks need to be placed and picked up first before they can be used.

# Quest.2859 - Combustion Engine

# Quest.2860 - Kinesis Pipes
gtnh.quest2860.name=Kinesis Pipes
gtnh.quest2860.desc=To transfer RF power more than 1 block, you'll want some kinesis pipes. Use a wooden one first to connect to the pipe network, then other types to transfer it. That said, they seem to be lossy somewhat, so conduits are better, if more expensive. Also, you need capacitors to store the RF anyway.

# Quest.2861 - §5§lPrison Gangs are Obsolete

BTW, it probably would've been faster to make more multifarms or farming stations instead.%n%nAlso, you still gotta create the ultimate hybrid, too.

# Quest.2874 - §1§lLoading the Chunks
gtnh.quest2874.name=§1§lLoading the Chunks
gtnh.quest2874.desc=In this, like many packs, you'll want to have things in your base keep running while you're off exploring. §3(Though admittedly once you reach midgame you'll spend almost no time off-base, you'll still want to make sure everything is still chunkloaded just in case to prevent machine explosions, especially for multiblocks)§r%n%nIn order to have things keep running, you need to have the chunks loaded. You can do this in a few ways.%n%n1) Install FTB Utilities and claim chunks, then set them to chunkload. By default you may not be able to claim/chunkload enough per player, so feel free to increase the number. You need to be in SP or running your own server to do this.%n%n2) Use an Anchor from Railcraft. There are 4 types. Anchors are not craftable until LV. In SP, or a server you run, cheat in Admin Anchors to chunkload forever, for free. They're limited on servers to prevent TPS dropping from people chunkloading a base forever when they aren't even there. On the officials, you need to use Ender Fragments, Ender Pearls, or Coins to fuel them. Look at the tooltip on each for how long it will work, and in what chunkloader. Feel free to limit yourself to chunkloading this way in SP if you want to make it more challenging though.%n%n3) Use chicken chunks to get anchor-like blocks. But don't do this, it's buggy.%n%n4) Use Chunkloader from GT++. You need EU instead of Ender Pearls.%n%n5) Use one of the blocks that chunkloads itself. If you do this on a server, expect the admins to possibly get very mad with you if it's not something you're allowed to do. Same for vanilla methods.

gtnh.quest2967.desc=A chemical fuel engine for LuV? Well, if you are a crazy fan of diesel or benzene, you will love it.%n%nThis engine accepts all diesel, gas and also rocket fuel, although the Rocketdyne burns the latter more efficiently. It also needs Combustion Promoter to keep it running.%n%nThis engine consumes all fuel and combustion promoter in its input hatches per second and outputs power depending on the amount of fuel consumed, and its fuel value.%n%nIts efficiency is determined by the Combustion Promoter/Fuel ratio. If the ratio is larger (there is more promoter), the efficiency will be higher. The max efficiency is 150%, but you cannot achieve this value without inputting an infinite amount of promoter. Expect efficiencies around 130% for high fuel value fuels like High-Octane Gasoline, unless you spend a LOT of promoter.%n%ne.g. You input 100mB/s of HOG and 1000mB/s of combustion promoter. The efficiency is 149% and the sum of the HOG fuel value is 250000 EU. The output power will be 250,000 * 149% / 20 = 18625 EU/t.

gtnh.quest2971.desc=You shouldn't click on links from strangers! Although this sounds like clickbait it is true. From a certain point of view.%n%nUse the (potential) force! And store energy that way. Simply construct a dam and floor vast areas with water. You may add energy to your storage by pumping more water into it or just drain it back into energy whenever you need. This works especially well with fluctuating energy sources like wind, water, and solar. Or you dump excess energy into it so you can use it another time. The capacity is huge and the choice is yours.%n%nSounds great! But...? - Indeed. There is a catch: Pumps and Turbines will have efficiency correlated loss. Still interested? Let's get to crafting!%n%nThe multi-block has an unusual shape: the back is open. The lake will spawn inside the multi-block and spread block-by-block as far as it can/is allowed. It will replace plants like water (make sure to secure your IC2 Crops!) but not replace any solid blocks. Additionally, you can specify limits in any direction. The water will NEVER spread past these limits. You can set those limits in a second GUI by right clicking the controller with a screwdriver.%n%nWhen you enter a limit, it will correct itself to the nearest valid setting. Especially if you try to spread past the server limits. You may talk your admin into raising these limits (these limits are designed to limit griefing). Further, water is not able to spread into foreign towns.%nYou will also find 3 magical buttons in the top-right of this GUI. From left to right: The first will slowly despawn the lake blocks. You can use this to shrink the lake if it spread past a barrier for example. The multi-block will also initialize with this configuration so there is no accidental flooding. The second and third buttons will slowly spawn more lake blocks. Additionally, the second button will render those lake blocks pink so you see where they are so you may plug holes and such. In this "debug" mode you can walk/breathe/act in the lake like in air. This should make it easy to create a sunken village for decoration purposes. The third button is for normal operations so you can see the water and enjoy a swim in your energy buffer.%n%nOf course, there is also a normal GUI (simple right-click). It shows you the energy stored in the dam. To reach higher water levels you are required to use stronger pumps. For this purpose, you may configure the voltage tier of the GUI with a circuit in the circuit slot. Don't worry: It is only optical. You cannot void any energy if you set a low voltage tier. It is only for the player information. You may give it a try with the reward you earn...%n%nIf you have any further questions, find missing information, or have suggestions please do not hesitate to post on the official GT New Horizons Discord.

# Quest.2972 - §6§lGotta Pump It Up
gtnh.quest2972.name=§6§lGotta Pump It Up
gtnh.quest2972.desc=If you made it this far you may already noticed that you cannot pour vanilla water into the dam. That’s what a HydroEnergy Pump is for. This multi-block exists in multiple tiers and will allow you to reach higher water levels (= more energy capacity). Provide the pump with vanilla water as input and pipe the fluid output into the dam. Then the dam will slowly fill up. If the dam is full or full for a pump’s voltage tier, it will void the water and energy.%n%nThat's all folks! Nothing too fancy here.%n%nIf you have any further questions, missing information or suggestions please do not hesitate to post on the official GT New Horizons Discord.

# Quest.2973 - §6§lLet if flow, let it floww ...
gtnh.quest2973.name=§6§lLet if flow, let it floww ...
gtnh.quest2973.desc=... can't hold it back anymore. It is time to collect the rewards of your hard work. Connect the fluid output hatch from the dam to the fluid input hatch of this turbine and finally enjoy the power! You can pause this multiblock if you cut the fluid input or use a machine controller. Oh, and you will get your water back in the fluid output hatch.%n%nCongratulations to making it this far! Enjoy your ginormous energy buffer!%n%nIf you have any further questions, missing information or suggestions please do not hesitate to post on the official GT New Horizons Discord.

# Quest.2974 - §6§lAluminium Hydroxide
gtnh.quest2974.name=§6§lAluminium Hydroxide
gtnh.quest2974.desc=To get ingots straight from aluminium dust you'll need higher temperatures then cupronickel coils can provide. One alternative route is to lower the required temperature by turning it into aluminiumhydroxide dust. It can be processed to alumina. You can also use it to make cryolite.

# Quest.2975 - §6§lChemical cryolite production
gtnh.quest2975.name=§6§lChemical cryolite production
gtnh.quest2975.desc=Feeling too lazy to search for a cryolite vein to smelt all this alumina? You can always synthesize it with hydroflouric acid, sodium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide.

# Quest.2976 - §6§lAdvanced aluminium production
gtnh.quest2976.name=§6§lAdvanced aluminium production
gtnh.quest2976.desc=After you have made an MV chemical reactor you are able to create some sodium aluminate. In this process you will also get a lot of hydrogen.

# Quest.2977 - §9§lAdvanced alumina production
gtnh.quest2977.name=§9§lAdvanced alumina production
gtnh.quest2977.desc=You can smelt 24 sodium aluminate down into 15 alumina dust. Sodium carbonate will be left over.

# Quest.2978 - §9§lRed Mud
gtnh.quest2978.name=§9§lRed Mud
gtnh.quest2978.desc=Red mud is a byproduct from bauxite processing. You can get few useful materials out of it by centrifuging.%n%n§3Unless you want the red mud specifically, you are probably better off processing your bauxite in a different way. Specifically electrolysis or mixing it with sodium hydroxide to make sodium aluminate.

# Quest.2979 - §5§6§l§5§lAluminium Tank
gtnh.quest2979.name=§5§6§l§5§lAluminium Tank
gtnh.quest2979.desc=If you make some Double Aluminium Plates, you can make a new 96,000L single block tank.

# Quest.2980 - §a§9§a§9§l§9§a§lPlaying With Dust in EV
gtnh.quest2980.name=§a§9§a§9§l§9§a§lPlaying With Dust in EV
gtnh.quest2980.desc=The EV Autoclave is needed to process tungsten and other high tier materials. 

# Quest.2981 - §6§6§6§l§r§6§l§5§l§o§l§r§6§A§l§A§6§lAir-Filter
gtnh.quest2981.name=§6§6§6§l§r§6§l§5§l§o§l§r§6§A§l§A§6§lAir-Filter
gtnh.quest2981.desc=Electric Air Filter%n%nThis wonderful multiblock comes in 3 versions:§9 §rT1 for LV, T2 for late HV and T3 for IV.%n%n§r§9§rIt has 2 modes:%n%n§9§r- a normal mode, where one chunk is processed at a time in the working area, in order, per pollution cleaning cycle.%n- a random mode, where the chunk being cleaned is picked randomly between all the polluted chunks in the working area.%n§r%nTo cycle between the modes, right click on the controller with a screwdriver.%n%n§9§rThe controller can change its working area from 1x1 to (2*tier+1) x (2*tier+1) chunks. To do that, right click with a screwdriver on the controller while sneaking. The default size is the maximum working area.%n%n§r§9§rThe pollution removal calculation is equals (by default) to 30 * bonusMultiTier * Muffler Hatches * Turbine Eff * Multiblock Eff * 2.5 ^ Effective Tier where:%n%n- BonusMultiTier is a boost given by the multiblock tier. T1 is 1 (0%), T2 is 1.05 (5%) and T3 is 1.10 (10%)%n%n- Muffler Hatches is the amount of muffler hatches on the multiblock (up to 8)%n%n- Turbine Eff is the efficiency of the turbine chosen to run the multi. It won't run if there is no turbine in the controller.%n%n- Multiblock Eff is the efficiency of the multiblock (100% when no maintenance issue, -10% per issue)%n%n- Effective Tier is the Effective Tier of the multi: the minimum tier between the electric tier of the multi and the tier of the muffler hatches%n%n§rThe pollution cleaning is boosted by two (by default) when using an Absorption Filter. When added in the input bus, it will be consumed and used for 30 (by default) successful pollution cleaning cycle. If a chunk with no pollution in it is processed, that doesn't count as successful, and the multi decides that a chunk has no pollution if the pollution is below 10k gibbl (by default). After the 30th successful pollution cleaning cycle, the output bus will give a Dirty Absorption Filter.%n%nTo know if an Absorption Filter is present and how many remaining cycles there are, use an portable scanner on the controller.%n%n§9§rA pollution cycle lasts 10s, and the cleaning is done every second.

# Quest.2982 - §6§lAbsorption Filter
gtnh.quest2982.name=§6§lAbsorption Filter
gtnh.quest2982.desc=When you reach MV tier you can make your own Absorption Filter for the Air Filter to clean pollution much more efficient. The Filter will be consumed and you get a dirty Filter back after 30 Cycles.

# Quest.2983 - §6§lMica Ore
gtnh.quest2983.name=§6§lMica Ore
gtnh.quest2983.desc=Mica is a very rare but useful ore. You need it in order to craft your high tier coils for the EBF.%nIf you have no luck in finding this vein yet try to look for it with a Prospector..

# Quest.2984 - Simple Distillation
gtnh.quest2984.name=Simple Distillation
gtnh.quest2984.desc=As rich as Oil is, it's hardly useful for anything in this state. One of the most important parts in the processing chain is distillation, which separates the components of this black mixture from their difference in density, or how "heavy" they are. You can do this in a Distillery, starting in LV, but only one of the fractions can be obtained at a time: you must choose which one you want.%n%nLighter fractions are generally more useful than heavier ones, but that doesn't mean that lightest is best. For now, going for Sulfuric Light Fuel is the best option, since it will become a good source of power after being treated. Don't use the Oil to power these machines, stick to Steam until you can use something better.

# Quest.2985 - §6§6§a§9§8§7§6§5§4§3§2§1§0§3§f§k§f§l§6§lYou Are Not Prepared... But They Are
gtnh.quest2985.name=§6§6§a§9§8§7§6§5§4§3§2§1§0§3§f§k§f§l§6§lYou Are Not Prepared... But They Are
gtnh.quest2985.desc=Building a smeltery from ground up can be really tedious and time consuming. How about go borrow one from the locals? They will surely be happy to share it with an unfriendly adventurer that just dismantlled their bricked railway station.%n%nThe villager are too dumb that they spent all their seared bricks without adding a few key components like faucets or drains. You still need to craft some smeltry bricks yourselves... %n%nTotally not useful tip: if you hold off building this long enough, you will be able to break down seared brick blocks into seared brick items with a forge hammer or extractor.%n%n§3Unfortunately, going down this path means we will not give you quest rewards, since you are already getting this important multiblock for free. Check the checkbox to signify your consent.

# Quest.2986 - Here's Some Oil
gtnh.quest2986.name=Here's Some Oil
gtnh.quest2986.desc=Welcome! This is the questline that shows the path through oil processing towards all the useful items and fluids that can be obtained from it. Working with this black liquid involves a lot of steps that range from LV (Low Voltage), all the way to IV (Insane Voltage), and outputs that are useful at those tiers and beyond. %n%nOil is useful both for generating power, and to automate a lot of chemicals that are important for progression. As you progress, you will be able to get more of it, and get it faster, as well as process it in new ways that improve on the setup that you were using before. It is not a required path for progression in the pack, but it is a very useful one, should you choose to follow it.%n%nThe best way to start working with oil is to extract it from the surface. Oil spouts are visible without having to dig down, and they can be interacted with by using a Pump placed above them, alongside a generator that feeds it some power. You can use some of the Oil to generate this power for now.

# Quest.2987 - Oil Drilling Rig
gtnh.quest2987.name=Oil Drilling Rig
gtnh.quest2987.desc=In the MV tier, Oil gets a big boost in its effectiveness, and becomes a fantastic powergen option for anyone wanting to switch off Steam, if they haven't done it already. It becomes difficult to use Steam as the only power source in this tier, so you should find a more reliable way to get power.%n%nOf course, you might already be using Light Fuel as your power source of choice, but a different question might have popped up in your mind by now: is there a better way to get Oil? Perhaps you have run short, or perhaps not. Either way, there is a multi unlocked in this tier that can greatly facilitate the automation of Oil input into your Distillery. That multi is the Oil Drilling Rig, which can pump it from below bedrock, but only if there is some in the current chunk, which means that you will have to scan the chunks around you to find it.%n%nThere is a quest for this rig in the Multiblock Goals tab. Go check it out!

# Quest.2988 - Distillation Tower
gtnh.quest2988.name=Distillation Tower
gtnh.quest2988.desc=In HV, your oil processing options soar to new levels of complexity, and efficiency. Many of the processing multis that can be used are unlocked in this tier, and one of the most iconic is the Distillation Tower, the direct upgrade of the Distillery.%n%nThis tower can do actual fractional distillation, a process used in real life petrochemistry to separate oil into many different parts, based on their density. The tall structure is required for the process, because the different densities force the chemicals to settle at different heighs, sitting above the others that are heavier than them. If the outputs of these recipes aren't ordered by density, though, don't complain to the developers, it isn't always fully realistic.%n%nThat said, the Distillation Tower replaces Distilleries by outputting every chemical that you can choose from, all at once, from the same amount of input. This means that the tower is both more efficient, and also allows automation of all the outputs at the same time, but this comes at a cost: the controller needs EV circuits, which require a built Cleanroom, and the structure blocks are mostly made of Stainless Steel. Not only that, but the tower's height depends on the recipe, since each output needs its own height level to successfully be extracted. A max-height, 12-block tall DT can cost almost a dozen stacks of stainless to build, a very expensive multi for the tier.%n%nInstead of doing that, the first DT you should build is a 5-block tall one, to distill the Oil you're pumping out of reservoirs. Doing this, you can get all the fractions at once, for a reasonably cheap multi, compared to its maximum size.

# Quest.2989 - The Era of Multis
gtnh.quest2989.name=The Era of Multis
gtnh.quest2989.desc=What does this mean, "the era of multis"? I've built so many multis already!%n%nWell, yes, but now it's all multiblocks. There are still singleblock machines for all the tasks they're needed for, but at IV the newer GT++ multis become available, or at least most of them, which can do the same jobs of bending, extruding, extracting, amongst others, but with higher initial investments and many bonuses to their processing. Remember what I said before about higher initial investments being worth it?%n%nThat said, there isn't a new oil processing chain in IV, you only improve what you already have. If there was a step in the chain that was running too slow, and you needed to add more machines to it or overclock, it's likely that there is now a multi that can take over that role by itself. Tungstensteel is usually an important part of these things, so get it automated in anticipation of what's to come.

# Quest.2990 - Generator Power
gtnh.quest2990.name=Generator Power
gtnh.quest2990.desc=Welcome to EV! If you thought the previous tier had a big jump in oil processing, you are correct, but now it's going to jump up all over again!%n%nThis tier does not unlock new processing multis like HV did, but it does bring better, much better generators. From now on, your main generators options will almost always be multiblocks, unless you need an easy-to-move generator for a multiblock miner or something similar. For your diesel fuels, the next step is the Large Combustion Engine (LCE), and there is a quest for it on the Multiblock Goals tab as usual. This, however, is a big investment in Titanium, amongst other things, so I hope you have that processing automated already.%n%nIf you boost the LCE, you will get both a huge boost in EU/t and efficiency. While an HV Diesel Generator had an output of 512 EU/t at 85% efficiency, this expensive multi outputs 6144 EU/t at 150% efficiency! Make sure you have an EV Buffered Dynamo Hatch that can handle this output.%nThere is an equivalent turbine for gases, like the Refinery Gas you might be using to power your oil processing setup, which is cheaper to build but its performance depends on the turbine placed inside it, and you won't be able to get near the levels of the LCE unless you get some Tungstensteel, and a good metal like Shadow Metal.

# Quest.2991 - Dessulfurizing
gtnh.quest2991.name=Dessulfurizing
gtnh.quest2991.desc=After distillation, the fluid you got still isn't that good. It can be used for power, but it's almost as bad as Oil itself unless you remove the sulfuric content it has. This applies for all the portions that can be distilled from Oil, and as such it's a required step regardless of which one you're working with. %n%nTo get clean Light Fuel, the sulfur needs to be drawn out with something that reacts with it, in a Chemical Reactor. What you need is Hydrogen, a relatively common gas that can be electrolyzed from water, or from specific ores (check NEI for all the possible sources). After reacting, you will get Hydrogen Sulfide and the clean Light Fuel, which can be further processed or burned for power at this stage.

# Quest.2992 - Light Fuel Power
gtnh.quest2992.name=Light Fuel Power
gtnh.quest2992.desc=Light Fuel is a great power source in LV, for several reasons. Not only is it much more power-dense than Steam, which means that you need a smaller amount of it to get the same EU amount, but the generators that can burn it have a higher fuel efficiency than the Steam ones. Even wooden fluid pipes will be enough to transport this fuel!%n%nThat said, your old generators will not accept Light Fuel, so you will have to make some Diesel Generators to get power out of it. You'll still get one LV amp out of each, which means you might have to make more if you are running several machines at once. By the time you build your first Electric Blast Furnace, you will want 4 of these feeding it power.

# Quest.2993 - Basic Cracking
gtnh.quest2993.name=Basic Cracking
gtnh.quest2993.desc=Despite what the Distillery recipe might have led you to believe, there are many more fractions of Oil than the four you could choose from. However, to get the rest of the oil byproducts, you need to split these four into the others, a process known as cracking. To crack the fuels, they must not be sulfuric, and you will need either Hydrogen (hydro-cracking) or Steam (steam-cracking) to successfully crack. Your Hydrogen source for dessulfurizing is hopefully good enough to sustain hydro-cracking, and the Steam you were previously using for power can now be useful to get more out of the Oil you're pumping.%n%nHeavy Fuel, Light Fuel, Refinery Gas and Naphtha can each be cracked both ways, and with three different intensities: lightly, moderately or severely cracked. This means that each portion has 6 different cracking options, and the products of distilling them can be cracked once more! There are a lot of options here, but a few of them stand out for their usefulness.%n%nThe first one you should attempt starts with Naphtha, instead of Light Fuel, so switch your Distillery to produce that, and get some Steam.

# Quest.2994 - Early Ethylene
gtnh.quest2994.name=Early Ethylene
gtnh.quest2994.desc=In LV, cracking fuels is only possible in a Chemical Reactor, which has a lower efficiency than the Oil Cracker multiblock that is available at HV. That said, it is still a great source of some fluids, one of which being Ethylene, the precursor to Polyethylene, the first plastic that can be produced and a required part of progression in the pack. To obtain Ethylene from Oil, the best way to go is to severely steam-crack Naphtha.%n%nSimply put the Naphtha and the Steam in a Chemical Reactor with the correct circuit (check NEI) and then distill the cracked Naphtha. It can give a lot of different outputs, so make sure you choose the right one. After doing this, you'll have successfully processed Oil, both for power and for byproducts. Congratulations!

# Quest.2995 - Sulfuric Acid
gtnh.quest2995.name=Sulfuric Acid
gtnh.quest2995.desc=This sulfuric waste that came out of the oil fractions could be voided, but it's actually a useful byproduct for your progression. The Hydrogen Sulfide that you obtained, mixed with Water in another Chemical Reactor will give back Diluted Sulfuric Acid, which can be turned into its more concentrated form by distilling it.%n%nSulfuric Acid is one of the most important chemicals in the pack, so make sure to use this opportunity to automate it. It's needed for circuits, amongst other things, so you will need a lot of it.

# Quest.2996 - Oil Reservoirs
gtnh.quest2996.name=Oil Reservoirs
gtnh.quest2996.desc=Unlike the oil spouts that are visible on the surface, the underground reservoirs cannot be seen or measured without the use of specific tools. To find one, you can make a Seismic Prospector and power it by using some kind of explosive (there is a quest for this, which gives the necessary items as rewards). After it has finished working, using a Data Stick on it will give back the raw information from the prospecting, which needs to be put in a Scanner, and then into a Printer, which will give back some pages. Make a book from those pages and you will be able to read the information about reservoirs, and also ores found in the vicinity.%n%nUpon finding a reservoir, you can see the type of oil and its amount within an area of 8x8 chunks. There are five types of Oil in reservoirs, not to be confused with the four portions obtained after oil distillation:%n%nOil - The same as what is found in oil spouts, and usually the kind you want;%nRaw Oil - Equivalent to Oil, but only gives half the outputs per bucket;%nLight Oil - Gives mostly Sulfuric Gas, not useful in general;%nHeavy Oil - Gives mostly Heavy Fuel, handy if you need some for Diesel or other purposes;%nNatural Gas - Turns into Refinery Gas when reacted with Hydrogen;%n%nThe amount of Oil in the reservoir is very important! Values in the 400s or above are good, and slowly decrease over time as the Oil is pumped, which means that large reservoirs will last for a very long time. If you find one, it's unlikely you'll run out until much later in progression.

# Quest.2997 - More Hydrogen
gtnh.quest2997.name=More Hydrogen
gtnh.quest2997.desc=With more Oil in your hands, you are sure to have problems with the other inputs you need. Hydrogen is required to get any type of clean byproduct, and the amount you need scales with the speed at which your Chemical Reactors work. It is possible to get a lot of it from ores, and mining out a Limonite vein will get you enough to last a long while, but it will eventually run out. Which automatic sources can you choose from?%n%nThe simplest option is to electrolyze water. You can just keep feeding water for free, but it's a slow and inefficient process, although it also gives you Oxygen. You will need a few Electrolyzers running to keep it going at a decent pace. %n%nAn alternative option is to do this, but with salt water, obtained from Ghast Tears, if you have delved into IC2 crops. Tearstalks are a tier 8 crop that produce these tears, and you can get a few useful dusts, alongside automated Chlorine that you will need very often in the next two tiers.%n%nLastly, did you know what most of the oil byproducts are organic compounds, and as such are made mostly of Carbon and Hydrogen? You can electrolyze most of them to get these elements, at a faster rate than water, but only if you have leftovers. Methane is one of the choices that you might have stockpiling, but you should note that these byproducts often have fuel values, and it's often better to use them as fuel to electrolyze water.%n%nEither way, you will need Electrolyzers. Build some to continue!

# Quest.2998 - Heavy Fuel
gtnh.quest2998.name=Heavy Fuel
gtnh.quest2998.desc=There is a better way to get fuel from Oil in MV, but you will need to expand into other fractions instead of just using Light Fuel. The next step is Diesel, and it is a mix of 5 buckets of Light Fuel with 1 bucket of Heavy Fuel, turning into 6 buckets of Diesel that each have a higher fuel value than the fuel used in LV.%n%nTo automate this from regular Oil, you will need another Distillery and Chemical Reactor, and finally a Mixer to put the fuels together. There are other possible sources of Heavy Fuel, mentioned on another quest in this chain, which can be of assistance if the input of Oil into the setup isn't very high. You will also need more Hydrogen, so get on it!

# Quest.2999 - Diesel
gtnh.quest2999.name=Diesel
gtnh.quest2999.desc=Finally, the oil of the gods. At least, early gods.%n%nDiesel, as a power source, has widely been known as the optimal choice all the way up to EV, when you unlock the ability to make nukes. It can be further upgraded into Cetane-Boosted Diesel in HV, by adding another chemical chain to it, but a fuel value of 480k EU on a fuel that needs so few machines to be made is quite exceptional. It should be automated as soon as possible, to ensure that you won't run out of power when you need it the most.%n%nAt this stage, you can use either LV or MV Diesel Generators. Using the LV ones will mean you need to make more of them, and more pollution, but they have 95% fuel efficiency compared to MV's 90%. It's a difference, but an automated Diesel setup is unlikely to be affected by a 5% change in efficiency.%n%nAs you progress, fuel will become more and more power-dense, but also need more steps automated. The next tier is much harder than this one, so get ready!

# Quest.3000 - More Oil Options
gtnh.quest3000.name=More Oil Options
gtnh.quest3000.desc=Alongside the Oil Drilling Rig, there are other sources you can explore. For Heavy Oil, a good source might be Oilsands Ore, which is found in rare veins at high altitudes. If you find one, you will have a large amount of Heavy Fuel to make Diesel with after processing.%n%nThere are also renewable sources of Oil, namely from IC2 crops and bees. The Oilberry crop can produce it indefinitely, but at a very slow rate, whereas bees can do it much faster, particularly Refined Bees, but they are much harder to obtain.%n%nYou can also get more out of the Oil by cracking it in specific ways. Lightly Hydrocracked Heavy Fuel, for example, gives 60% of the input amount as Light Fuel, which can be helpful if you have an excess of Heavy, and not enough Light to make Diesel.

# Quest.3001 - Using All the Fractions
gtnh.quest3001.name=Using All the Fractions
gtnh.quest3001.desc=After getting all the oil fractions at once, what is a player supposed to do with them? They'll pile up in the tanks or output hatches, and the Distillation Tower will keep running even if it cannot output something; everything that cannot be output will just be voided instead, and it's in your best interest to avoid this waste. What do, then?%n%nFirst off, it's important to note that almost everything you get from Oil can be processed into even more things. Whether or not the step is worthwhile is a different story altogether, and most of them aren't. That said, you're free to look through NEI or the spreadsheet to decide what you want to do, and how you want to do it. The charm of a processing chain like this, at least for me, is that it lets you choose your own path and gives you the information to know how to best utilize it.%n%nSecond off, Oil is a major source of byproducts, many of which will be needed to create other materials that are necessary, or simply helpful in progression. However, this isn't the only way to obtain most of them, and you might already found other sources, especially if you've dabbled in the Benzene or the Biomass chains. It's imperative that you automate most of them, but the way you do it is up to you.%n%nNow, for the four fractions that you get from regular Oil. Up until now, the power generation needed both Light Fuel and Heavy Fuel processing, and Naphtha already proved to be a good source of Ethylene. What can these be used for, in case you can build more DTs to process the cracked fluids? Roughly speaking, these are the possibilities:%n%nLight Fuel: You will most likely be using most, or all of this to make Diesel. If you do have leftovers, moderately hydrocracking it is a good source of Propene, and lightly hydrocracking is the best source for Octane. These two are important, but only in EV, for epoxy and powergen, specifically;%n%nHeavy Fuel: If only working with regular Oil, a lot of this will also be consumed to make Diesel. However, it's important to get more of it automated, since it can be distilled directly to make three fantastic byproducts: Toluene, Phenol and Benzene. All of them are important for progression, so make sure you pay attention to this recipe. Toluene is especially useful in HV, as you will need many buckets of it to be able to get into EV, when making your first rocket;%n%nNaphtha: You're probably already distilling this for Ethylene. You could switch this recipe into a Distillation Tower, but keep in mind that you need to build a max-height one to cover the entire recipe. However, if you do it, you will have most of the Oil byproducts automated, in more or less quantity, meaning that it's worth it to tackle this challenge when you get comfortable with making lots of Stainless Steel;%n%nRefinery Gas: This is probably the least useful portion, even with DTs. More often than not, it's used as the power source to keep the entire chain working, although you need Gas Turbines instead of Diesel Generators to do this. Alternatively, you can distill it into Methane and/or Helium without cracking it, if you don't need the power.

# Quest.3002 - Oil Cracker
gtnh.quest3002.name=Oil Cracker
gtnh.quest3002.desc=Another HV multi, and another Stainless Steel sink. Not only that, but it needs 16 coils to work! There is a quest about this multi in the Multiblock Goals tab, as per usual.%n%nDespite being expensive, this is an important multiblock to build. It does the cracking recipes like the Chemical Reactor does, and you might even be tempted to make an LCR for this purpose, since it's cheap and can do many recipes at once, but the Oil Cracker is much more efficient and gives several bonuses when used (check the tooltip for more information). As it stands, it's a higher initial investment that will pay off in the long run, many times over, and in this pack everything takes a long time, so get on it!

# Quest.3003 - Boosting the Diesel
gtnh.quest3003.name=Boosting the Diesel
gtnh.quest3003.desc=As you might have guessed, extra byproducts is not the only thing that HV does with Oil. On top of that, you can further improve the main fuel that you use for power, and this builds on the previous tier, as Diesel did from Light Fuel. As before, you will need to mix the fuel you have with something else to improve it, but it is not a direct byproduct this time. Instead, it's a chemical that requires a complicated processing chain to produce, at a much higher EU cost, with only a tiny amount needed to create the next fuel, Cetane-Boosted Diesel.%n%nTo make this additive, Tetranitromethane (TNM), you will need to source several chemicals you might have not used yet. I hope you have some Distillation Towers handy, because they will be very useful for this.

# Quest.3004 - Special Rubber from Oil
gtnh.quest3004.name=Special Rubber from Oil
gtnh.quest3004.desc=Another one of the Oil "specials" is Butadiene. It can be used in a few ways, including power, but where it shines is in making advanced rubber, specifically Styrene-Butadiene Rubber. You can make it in HV, but it is not required to have an improved rubber until the start of IV. There is a questline for this in the HV tab, so go check it out.%n%nThere is an equivalent alternative, Silicone Rubber, made from other inputs. They are mostly interchangeable, but they each have some unique use that makes it so you should have a good supply of both. 

# Quest.3005 - Distilled Heavy Fuel
gtnh.quest3005.name=Distilled Heavy Fuel
gtnh.quest3005.desc=You don't always have to crack the base fuels to get useful chemicals out of them. The best example of this is Heavy Fuel, whose recipe only has 3 outputs, but they're all excellent. This is the perfect format for a Distillation Tower automation, so get on it as soon as you can, you won't regret it!%n%nAs a sidenote, all of these are power-dense, and can be used for power if you stockpile a lot of them. Benzene is the first one you should use for this purpose, if you wish to do it, because the other two are core chemicals for required progression in HV and EV. However, Benzene can also turn into several useful chemicals, so don't burn it all for power.

# Quest.3006 - Acetone and Ethenone
gtnh.quest3006.name=Acetone and Ethenone
gtnh.quest3006.desc=Another ingredient in the making of TNM is Ethenone, which can be made directly from Acetone. This one is a little more organic, which is to say it's much easier to automate if you chose Benzene or Biomass. From those routes, you can get it from a Wood Vinegar DT, or reacting Acetic Acid with Calcite Dust from a Fermented Biomass DT (get the calcite from electrolyzing Fertilizer). If you used biomass to get Ammonia, you can do it this way.%n%nIf not using plants, though, there are other ways to automate this. Ethenone can be made directly from Acetic Acid and Sulfuric Acid, and this last one should already be automated from cleaning the sulfuric waste from the oil fractions. Acetic Acid, on the other hand, is a mix of Oxygen and Ethylene, a combo that you might have already automated to make Polyethylene. If not, this a good time to do so. %n%nThe amount of Ethenone you need to make a lot of Cetane-Boosted Diesel is small, so it's unlikely that you'll run out of Sulfuric Acid for this. Make sure you automate it all, though.

# Quest.3007 - Ammonia Source
gtnh.quest3007.name=Ammonia Source
gtnh.quest3007.desc=One of the components of Tetranitromethane is Nitric Acid, which is made from Nitrogen Dioxide, and this from Nitrogen Oxide, which is ultimately created from Ammonia. You can do a small Chemical Reactor chain to do this line of recipes, but the better option is to make an LCR and use the circuit 24 recipe to turn Ammonia and Oxygen directly into Nitric Acid.%n%nYou'll still need to automate Ammonia, though, and there are two main ways of doing this. One of the options is to create it directly from Nitrogen and Hydrogen, but this recipe consumes a lot of EU. The other option is to switch to the biological side of things and get it from the DT recipe of Fermented Biomass, but this requires a whole another setup with sapling automation, a Pyrolyse Oven and some other machines, so don't do it unless you're interested in getting the other outputs of that recipe. It, however, might be a good option if you don't have those yet. Either way, automate your Ammonia.%n%n

# Quest.3008 - Tetranitromethane as Additive
gtnh.quest3008.name=Tetranitromethane as Additive
gtnh.quest3008.desc=If both Nitric Acid and Ethenone are automated, then you can now get TNM effortlessly!%n%nIf you look at the recipe, you'll see that you need a lot more Nitric Acid than anything else. Given that Ammonia is the most power-hungry recipe, this is what will cut down into the fuel efficiency at the end, but not nearly enough to discourage the creation and use of CBD. Not only that, but if you check the uses of TNM, you'll see that you can treat Biodiesel the same way, although at a higher cost due to its lower fuel value, if you happened to have it.

# Quest.3009 - Cetane-Boosted Diesel
gtnh.quest3009.name=Cetane-Boosted Diesel
gtnh.quest3009.desc=If you made it here, then you should be ready to make Cetane-Boosted Diesel flow into your generators by itself. Congratulations!%n%nOil is still the best power option in HV, building up from what you used in LV. This CBD you've made will help fuel your EBFs, get into space and then handle the increased power needs that EV will throw at you, especially if you want to make an AE2 network for quick automation. Your singleblock generators are at the lowest efficiency yet, 85%, but the fuel you use now has a fuel value of 1 million EU per bucket, a very powerful liquid compared to any other you could make at this time.%n%nI'll see you on EV. Good luck when you make it there.

# Quest.3010 - Superpowered Fuel
gtnh.quest3010.name=Superpowered Fuel
gtnh.quest3010.desc=As did all tiers until now, the EV tier introduces a new type of bigger, better liquid fuel to burn on engines, High-Octane Gasoline. However, this one doesn't use the previous fuel, and instead takes a different oil-based route, which means that the CBD you have is of no use in this processing chain.%n%nAlso as before, the amount of processing you will need is greatly increased, and you can expect to need a lot more DTs, Oil Crackers, LCRs and other machines. You will also have to automate the input of materials from other sources, since Oil cannot provide you with everything anymore. You can overclock the multis you have, or build more of them, your choice. In the end, you'll have a fuel that is 2.5x more powerful than CBD, at an impressive fuel value of 2.5 million EU, and more byproducts than you could ever imagine. %n%nYou might have to crack one of the four oil fractions into the other ones, and you will surely need to pump Oil faster and faster to keep up with the power needs that will come when jumping to IV. I do recommend you use AE2 to automate the setup, relying on fluid P2Ps to transport fluids around, because it will make your life easier, even if it's harder to start and learn the setup. Either way you go, don't forget, you have to automate it.%n%n§4Work on making these important EV multis to continue.

# Quest.3011 - Boiler and Super Fuel
gtnh.quest3011.name=Boiler and Super Fuel
gtnh.quest3011.desc=With the advancements in building materials you've made until now, a new kind of generator has been unlocked. The Large Boilers you might have looked at before, and perhaps used, change when you reach Titanium, and if you build one of those, you will get something quite different from the tiers before.%n%nTo start, most burnable items don't work here. These advanced boilers need to burn much hotter, and as such they only accept specific fuels. The fuel of interest here is one of two, who are built in a sort of chain, in a similar fashion as to how Diesel and CBD worked. There is Solid Super Fuel, and Magic Solid Super Fuel, and they are both created from some coal-like block, some binder and some liquid fuel. You can use CBD for this, but Heavy Fuel and LPG are also options.%n%nWhy go through this route, though? The answer is that this extra processing, although it is difficult to automate, creates fuel that is much more efficient than the fuels that were put into it, and this is because the advanced Large Boilers are slow burners that output Superheated Steam, instead of regular one. This also means that they will need two turbines to convert all the steam into EU, and even more if the amount produced is too much for them. If fuel efficiency is something you're looking for, you can tackle this challenge and further process your CBD into something even more powerful.

# Quest.3012 - Improved Oil Cracker
gtnh.quest3012.name=Improved Oil Cracker
gtnh.quest3012.desc=Have you built an Oil Cracker? Have you checked its coils? This multi gets a significant discount to EU/t when upgrading the coils, but it caps at HSS-S, at a maximum of 50% discount. If you are still using low-tier coils, this is a great time to upgrade them to Nichrome and enjoy a 30% discount. You could also do Tungstensteel, but it's unlikely you have enough to pull this off at this time.%n%nBy the way, you can wall-share Oil Crackers, just like DTs, LCRs and many other multis, and doing this will save on the amount of coils you need!

# Quest.3013 - Magic Super Fuel
gtnh.quest3013.name=Magic Super Fuel
gtnh.quest3013.desc=Solid Super Fuel is an excellent fuel to burn in the Titanium Boiler, but you can do something even better than that. With a touch of magic, you can make yet another solid fuel with 50% more fuel value than the last one, but it's very likely that you will need Thaumcraft progression to automate this fully, should you wish to do so.%n%nIf you do want to do it, I recommend you also find a way to automate Coal, from IC2 crops for example, because the recipes that use it is much more efficient on liquid fuel than the other coals. You will also end up making more boilers, perhaps a quad Titanium Boiler, which will surely force you to increase the amount of Steam Turbines you'll have to make, but there is a catch here: you can screwdriver the turbines into Loose mode, which significantly decreases their efficiency but boosts their speed by something like 8 times, depending on the turbine you're using. Given that this process already boosts the efficiency of your fuels a lot, you may want to lose some of it to keep your number of turbines low.%n%nI'll leave the planning up to you.

# Quest.3014 - Raw Gasoline
gtnh.quest3014.name=Raw Gasoline
gtnh.quest3014.desc=At this point, you have almost all the additives needed to transform basic gasoline into the powerful HOG. What you'll need to do next is to create the gasoline itself, and this begins with Raw Gasoline. It has four different inputs, and each of them is sourced in a different way, but none of them are new: Naphtha and Refinery gas are well-known to you, Methanol was created in the previous quest and Acetone was explained in the "Acetone and Ethenone" quest in HV.%n%nAn important detail here is that Raw Gasoline is 80% Naphtha, and none of the oil types found in reservoirs produces that much of it. You will most likely find the amount you get to be short, but this problem has already been solved! Your source of Octane, if processed in a DT as explained, will also crack the Light Fuel into a lot of Naphtha that you can use here to compensate for the low amount you get from Oil. If you get low on Light Fuel, you can also crack Heavy Fuel to get some.

# Quest.3015 - Pushing with Anti-Knock Agent
gtnh.quest3015.name=Pushing with Anti-Knock Agent
gtnh.quest3015.desc=If you want your generators to last, you'll want to make this. In fact, since safety is always the priority, you can't make HOG without this Anti-Knock Agent, a mixture that keeps the fuel from damaging the engine even when it is this powerful. There are two paths to get this automated: one with an LCR recipe, and the other with a DT. The LCR option is cheaper to build, as per usual, but it consumes considerably more power than the DT path, so this quest will focus on the latter. As before, having an initial higher investment to save energy in the long run is the way to go.%n%nThe DT path is a cycle between a Mixer and the tower itself, where each distillation extracts a bit of Anti-Knock Agent from the MTBE Reaction Mixture, and will need to be mixed again. The two inputs needed for the setup are Butene and Methanol. Butene is obtainable from any of the max-height DT distillations, and Methanol from a mixture of Hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide/Carbon Monoxide. If you have a Fermented Biomass setup, you will already have CO2 ready to go, and Hydrogen can be sourced from a variety of ways.%n%nMake this cycle, and you'll have a safe fuel.

# Quest.3016 - Zooming with Nitrous
gtnh.quest3016.name=Zooming with Nitrous
gtnh.quest3016.desc=Nitrous Oxide, N2O, also known as nitro. It makes cars go really fast for short bursts. In reality, it is a source of extra oxygen when mixed in with the fuel during combustion, allowing it to be consumed faster and also release energy faster, but at the risk of "knocking", detonating the fuel out of its intended boundaries and possibly destroying the engine. %n%nTo avoid this, something else needs to be mixed in this HOG to prevent your generators from exploding, right? Luckily for you, such an option exists and it will be presented after this quest. For now, though, you can focus on automating Nitrous Oxide by mixing Nitrogen with Oxygen. These are the two main products of distilling air, so you can obtain them in one step, but you probably have chosen your source of these gases at this point, so use what you have.

# Quest.3017 - Speeding with Octane
gtnh.quest3017.name=Speeding with Octane
gtnh.quest3017.desc=One of the components of High-Octane Gasoline, as the name implies, is Octane. It is so important to improve the fuel because of something called "octane rating", which measures how much the fuel resists compression without detonating. The energy that vehicles get to move around comes from this detonation, but being able to apply more compression allows for engine designs that are more efficient, but need the fuel to resist that increased force without detonating. That said, any of these fuels can be run in the engines you use, so the way to represent this efficiency bonus is in the fuel value.%n%n(There is a multi in the next tier that only runs on HOG, though. Don't forget it.)%n%nHow is Octane obtained, then? In the last tier, it was explained as coming from Light Fuel, and this is still how you should, and can obtain it: lightly hydrocracked Light Fuel gives some Octane, so put a DT for it and leave your Diesel needs behind. It's time to move on.

# Quest.3018 - Gasoline
gtnh.quest3018.name=Gasoline
gtnh.quest3018.desc=Raw Gasoline is raw, obviously. To make it a proper fuel, it needs something explosive mixed in with it... what could you have that is considered explosive? Maybe the TNT, or what it's made of?%n%nYou have Toluene automated already, right? Get on it.

# Quest.3019 - High Octane Gasoline
gtnh.quest3019.name=High Octane Gasoline
gtnh.quest3019.desc=Gasoline is a regular fuel, as I'm sure you know. Nothing special about it, it's the same as Diesel but with a different density, for different engines. In real life, it's incredibly useful for the average person, but in GTNH it's mostly replaced by Diesel. However, that is about to change.%n%nThis step is by far the most complicated one in the entire chain, but you already automated all the additives you need, so this is just a matter of mixing. This is the EV step, the final step, so put your chemicals together. Add Octane to help the fuel resist compression after putting in the explosive Toluene, mix in the nitrous to juice it up and finish by controlling it with Anti-Knock Agent. Mix this all with Gasoline and you have HOG, the most powerful diesel fuel in the game.%n%nThere is more progression to the oil processing, and more quests from here, but this is it for fuel improvements. What is left for you is unlocking, and building even better generators that can take full advantage of how powerful HOG is. Nuclear Power is likely to be your next step in power, as diesels cannot last forever, but you can still continue through this path.%n%nOh, and congratulations! You have earned this reward.

# Quest.3020 - Largest Oil Drain
gtnh.quest3020.name=Largest Oil Drain
gtnh.quest3020.desc=One way or another, you will need to get Oil faster. Reservoirs can get really big, but the rig only pumps from a portion of them... until now. With a few stacks of Tungstensteel, you can put together the tier 3 of the Oil Rigs, and suck up all the fluid from a reservoir at once, covering the full 8x8 chunk size from a single spot. %n%nIf you need even faster Oil input, build more rigs! They'll draw from the same pool, and exhaust it together. If you put them on adjacent reservoir chunks, you can draw multiple full reservoirs at once and feed them into a central location, and this transportation becomes even easier with Ender Tanks, which are unlocked in this tier.

# Quest.3021 - Buffered Dynamo
gtnh.quest3021.name=Buffered Dynamo
gtnh.quest3021.desc=Another use for a few stacks of Tungstensteel is a new, even more powerful generator, but you can't run it just yet. Just like the LCE before it, the IV generator can't be run without a dynamo hatch that is powerful enough to keep up with the output, and in this case it applies to both the boosted and unboosted modes.%n%nWhat that means is that you need an IV Buffered Dynamo Hatch. The power will be worth it.

# Quest.3022 - Extreme Combustion Engine
gtnh.quest3022.name=Extreme Combustion Engine
gtnh.quest3022.desc=Very similar to the LCE in most aspects, the Extreme Combustion Engine was created to close the gap between the diesels and more advanced forms of powergen, mainly nuclear fusion. However, the main thing they differ on is the fuel that they can run, and in this case you're limited to the powerful fuel from the last tier, High Octane Gasoline.%n%nThat's right, only this fuel will work, and in exchange the ECE will output more than 10k EU/t. If you add Liquid Oxygen, which you'll need 4 Vacuum Freezers for (3 at HV and 1 at EV), you can keep it boosted permanently, which will send it up to 4 IV amps of power and 150% fuel efficiency. It's in your best interest to keep this thing going if you want to keep using Oil fuels for power, and the only thing you can rely on is your automated HOG setup, which you might have to, and should improve with the new IV multis as soon as you can, unless you have other sources of power working simultaneously.%n%nAs a last note, there is also an IV equivalent of the Vacuum Freezer, if you want to tackle the Liquid Oxygen needs that way. It's more power efficient, look it up on the GT++ tab.

# Quest.3023 - Super Distillation
gtnh.quest3023.name=Super Distillation
gtnh.quest3023.desc=Your tallest and closest buddy, the Distillation Tower. You've relied on it so much, haven't you? It's time to take it down.%n%nNo, not really, but you can do better now. The catch is that the upgrade to this, the Dangote Distillus, is special in the sense that its crafting recipe is in the Chemical Plant, and the one you have to build for this recipe is very expensive. Should you decide to accept the costs, though, you can build a Dangote in much the same way as the DT, and even upgrade it to tier 2 for better performance (look in NEI for a Distillus Chip, you have to put it in the controller). %n%nIn summary, this multi runs faster than the DT by doing parallels, a recipe done multiple times at once. A quad DT that you were using to distill Oil can be replaced by a Dangote, and so on. Since distillation is usually a bottleneck in speed for oil processing, this multi should prove useful.

# Quest.3024 - Maxed Oil Cracker
gtnh.quest3024.name=Maxed Oil Cracker
gtnh.quest3024.desc=How many oils have you cracked at this point? No matter the number, you can do it cheaper. Once you reach HSS-G coils, you will have achieved the maximum EU/t discount of 50% on your Oil Crackers, and enjoy the full array of benefits that they can provide you. Don't forget to overclock them if they're running slow, the energy cost is minimal at this point.

# Quest.3025 - Super Fuel At The Top
gtnh.quest3025.name=Super Fuel At The Top
gtnh.quest3025.desc=I was kidding, there's one more step in Oil, but it isn't really a better fuel, it's just the Tungstensteel Boiler.%n%nThis multi operates in the same fashion as the Titanium one. It needs a Super Fuel, it produces Superheated Steam and it makes you build a bunch of Steam Turbines to actually get power out of the fuel it consumes. The output energy of a single one of these boilers, at 100% efficiency, is 16k EU/t, so you'll need many turbines per boiler. You can build them like that, if you wish to, but at this point the Loose mode on those turbines is really useful. The efficiency hit is big, yes, but the Tungstensteel Boiler is 300% as efficient as the Bronze one, and a single Magic Solid Super Fuel burns for 4,5M EU at 100% turbine efficiency. Look at the amount of CBD you need to make one super fuel, and then you can decide if you want to tackle this super finale.%n%nYes, it's the end, basically. There is a couple of things you can still do, but I'll give you this as an award for having pushed through essentially all the Oil content in the pack. It has been a long journey, and I hope that you found it worthwhile and enjoyable.

# Quest.3026 - Breaking the Mold
gtnh.quest3026.name=Breaking the Mold
gtnh.quest3026.desc=Welcome, o' Baron of Oil. For you who has completed the 5 questlines of oil processing, a new chapter awaits you.%n%nThe following quests are not guidelines on how to work with oil. In reality, they are meant for tiers where you're not supposed to be using this kind of power anymore. However, if you do want to continue it, and push it as far as it can go, the following are a few challenges that you can take on, mostly for bragging rights.%n%nAll these challenges are for the tiers after IV. Some of them are for LuV, others need further progression. Good luck!

# Quest.3027 - Ultimate Distillation
gtnh.quest3027.name=Ultimate Distillation
gtnh.quest3027.desc=The Dangote Distillus is not enough for the goals of an oil baron. You might have heard about "mega" multiblocks, namely the Mega EBF, but did you know that a Distillation Tower equivalent exists?%n%nIt does the same thing as the Dangote, parallels, but it does 256 at a time, and is much, much bigger than anything you've built so far. My challenge to you is to build a max-height, full-sized Mega Distillation Tower, and come out of your efforts with the biggest multiblock that the pack has to offer. You will need more, much more casings than what the quest asks for, but your inventory is not big enough to hold the full amount that will need to build this monstrosity.

# Quest.3028 - Hyperheated Steam
gtnh.quest3028.name=Hyperheated Steam
gtnh.quest3028.desc=If there is someone who found themselves invested in the Large Tungstensteel Boilers, this one is for you. Through the pollution, the multiblock spamming and the chained processing lines you need to get here, you will find that this is a lot of heat for one boiler to handle. Why not make two quad boilers?%n%nYou might be thinking about the number of turbine multis you need to withstand this, but fret not! There are extra large turbines, for the extra large steam enthusiast. You will need four turbine items for each multi, and you best bring the best ones you can make! Loose mode is up to you, just go wild with your super fuel.%n%n§4You will need an Assembly Line to craft the dynamo needed to complete this quest.§r

# Quest.3029 - Universal Fuel Power
gtnh.quest3029.name=Universal Fuel Power
gtnh.quest3029.desc=This is the most powerful combustion engine that has ever been built. In fact, it's not only that, but also a Gas Turbine and a Rocket Fuel Generator!%n%nThe Universal Chemical Fuel Engine burns fuel with some additives, as did its predecessors, but it runs at a lower efficiency. The 150% value is a mathematical limit, you cannot reach it without supplying infinite fuel, but this engine compensates by running as fast as fuel is input into it, without the maximum EU/t limitation the others had. The only two things you have to make sure of are that you supply enough Combustion Promoter to keep efficiency up (I'll let you figure the best ratio on your own, but 1:4 promoter:fuel is decent), and that the dynamo can support the EU/t that the generator is outputting.%n%n§9§9§b§4You will need an Assembly Line to craft the dynamo needed to complete this quest. You better burn enough HOG to make it worth!§r 

# Quest.3030 - §6§lExpert MB-Construction
gtnh.quest3030.name=§6§lExpert MB-Construction
gtnh.quest3030.desc=Right click the controller while sneaking will invoke an action called §osurvival autoplace§r. This will attempt to build the multiblock with items from your inventory, provided the area this multi occupies is clear of obstacles. Again, like hologram spawning, multiblocks that accept multiple types of tiered components or has variable length, the number of MSHPs you hold in hand will decide which tier of blocks will be placed. It will place correct amount of hatches for you, but will usually orient the hatches towards you, not perpendicular to the surface. It will just place casings for you if you don't have any hatches in inventory, unless this spot require the use of a hatch (e.g. the top center spot of EBF).%n%nSurvival autoplace can also take from your alternative inventories, or items that contain/link to an inventory. Currently, this includes: %n- adventure backpacks, either worn or as an item in inventory%n- AE2 portable cells%n- ME network linked by any kind of AE2 wireless terminal that support item access. support view cell filtering, consume power, require security access and within wireless range%n- Forestry backpacks%n- ender chest inventory, if you have the Ender Backpack from Backpacks mod. Note: ordinary backpacks from the Backpacks mod are NOT supported at the moment.

gtnh.quest3031.desc=It's time for something really big: A smeltery! There's a lot to craft, so better gather some resources... or you could go try complete this with the help of some unhappy NPC friends, but that would void your quest rewards.%n%n§3Note: This quest is mutually exclusive with the other smeltry quest.

# Quest.3037 - Space Pumping
gtnh.quest3037.name=Space Pumping
gtnh.quest3037.desc=You might have already wondered: There are these enormous gas planets in the solar system - isn't there a way to "harvest" them? Indeed there is. By constructing the "Planetary Gas Siphon" multiblock, you are able to pump from the infinite supply of gas found on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. You just need to build a space station around a gas planet to get near enough to be able to reach the gas without falling into it.%n%nBy pumping on different depths, you are able to extract different gases. The depth is controlled by a Programmed Circuit. You need to supply 64 * depth Mining Pipes to be able to rach the selected depth.%n%nWhile operational, the multiblock needs d*4^(t+2) EU/t (t is the space station's tier and d is the depth).%n%nYou can find an overview of what you can pump where in the Tips and Tricks chapter.

# Quest.3038 - UHT Resistant Mesh
gtnh.quest3038.name=UHT Resistant Mesh
gtnh.quest3038.desc=§o*Slaps UHT Resistant Mesh* This bad boy can withstand so much heat!§r%n%nYou should probably automate this if you want to build and use the Dyson Swarm multiblock.

# Quest.3039 - Dyson Swarm Ground Unit
gtnh.quest3039.name=Dyson Swarm Ground Unit
gtnh.quest3039.desc=The Dyson Swarm Ground Unit multiblock is basically a solar panel, you just insert Dyson Swarm Modules (how many depends on how much energy you want) and get energy out. There are some complications though:%n- Each second, n of m Modules are destroyed according to this formula: n=X*0.0001*m^1.05, where X is a normally distributed random number between 0 and 2 with mean 1.%n- Needs 1000 L/s of Gelid Cryotheum.%n- Requires n computation per tick according to this formula: n=0.1*m^1.075-128, where m is the amount of modules. As you can see, you get 128 computation for free! Isn't that nice?%n%n§cNote: §9Tec§1Tech§r's Multi-Amp Dynamo Hatches and Laser Source Hatches are supported.%n%n§cNote: §rThe amount of each part on the right is only the minimum, depending on how many Dynamo Hatches, Input Busses, Input Hatches and Optical Slave Connectors you use, you may need more Energy Receiver Base Casings, Module Deployment Unit Base Casings or Control Center Base Casings.%n%n§6Fun fact: §rThe maximum output is 105,553,116,266,496 EU/t (limited by 12 UEV 1048576A/t Laser Source Hatches)

If you're not too sure where to get Iodine, have a look at Seaweed Ash. (hint: you'll need to look at small piles)%n%nNote that both the liquid and dust forms of iodine are optional, so you can complete the quest with one. Or none!%n%n

# Quest.3087 - §b§lThe Other Way
gtnh.quest3087.name=§b§lThe Other Way
gtnh.quest3087.desc=When you inevitably get Samarium Ore, you'll end up getting a ton of this dust. There are a couple of options here: One includes the monazite line and has a higher yield, the other is simpler but has a poorer yield.%nWe'll look at the latter here.%n%nEventually you'll probably want to switch entirely to the monazite option, but for now, supplementing it with this can be a good idea.

gtnh.quest3091.desc=Alternative way to mass produce Sunnarium.

# Quest.3092 - Renewable Energy
gtnh.quest3092.name=Renewable Energy
gtnh.quest3092.desc=Despite finding oil spouts in the wild, you might have thought about extending the source of power you have used to reach the age of electricity. Steam was your energy, and burnable items your source of that energy, with wood and charcoal being the most likely candidates for automating your first power generation steps. Steam itself, however, is not the best option for all progression tiers, so the question is: what else can that wood do? That is what this questline will explain.%n%nEach tier you reach will challenge you with bigger power needs. Not only do the energy tiers multiply by 4 every time you go up (32 EU/t for LV, 128 for MV, 512 for HV, etc.), but also the necessary growth of your setups, with more steps and each one becoming more complicated. To sustain all this, you might want a fully automated, infinite source of power and chemicals to handle this pack's progression. To achieve this, following the quests in this chapter is sure to be helpful.%n%nAs a final note, the power outputs of a fully renewable powergen like this are not as efficient as oil, which is the price to pay for being renewable. You will need a bigger machine setup to achieve the same EU/t output, but it is still very viable and worth it if you are willing to make this compromise. On the other hand, building these wood-related setups will give you some interesting chemicals to use in later crafts, chemicals that oil cannot directly create. You can choose one or the other, or just follow both paths at the same time if you're curious. It's up to you.

# Quest.3093 - Carbon, Chemically
gtnh.quest3093.name=Carbon, Chemically
gtnh.quest3093.desc=How does all of this organic stuff produce energy, anyways? You burn it, that's how! The heat from that burning heats up water into Steam, and this can make a Steam Turbine spin, generating rotational energy that can directly be converted into electricity with spinning magnetic fields. Pretty neat, right? The wood/charcoal provides the combustible material, and the atmosphere provides the oxygen to keep the fire going. With some chemistry, and GTNH magic, we can use these principles to generate power in an alternative way.%n%nIt's pretty much magic, really. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a valid fuel for Gas Turbines, and it can be made with Charcoal and Oxygen. The CO has more power than the Charcoal used to make it, but the additional Oxygen will make this step not worth it if you get it from electrolyzing water or centrifuging air, since the EU needed for those crafts will make this process inefficient. There is, however, a more efficient way to automate Oxygen production, but you will need crops for it.%n%nYour target is Sugar, since electrolyzing it will output Oxygen at almost 1000 EU per bucket. Each bucket of CO produces 24000 EU, made from one Charcoal that produces roughly 16000 EU in Steam, and costing 560 EU per craft. The whole process gives around 6000 EU of free power per Charcoal, around 30% extra power overall!%n%nTo get automated Sugar from crops, you want Sugar Beets. Sugar Canes do the same thing, but with more EU cost to get the Sugar. There are other possible ways but, for now, just get loads of Sugar.  

# Quest.3094 - Burning the Carbon
gtnh.quest3094.name=Burning the Carbon
gtnh.quest3094.desc=If you've automated Carbon Monoxide, you can now burn it directly for EU in a Gas Turbine. It does not use the Steam Turbines that the boilers required, which is a good thing for two reasons: Steam Turbines are less fuel efficient than their Gas or Combustion alternatives, and steam in itself needs large pipes to move it, being much less power dense than gases or diesels. Additionally, you don't even need boilers at all! You can skip them altogether if you invest in this CO route.%n%nYou also get Ashes from this chemical reaction. They can be used in several ways, take a look!

# Quest.3095 - Sourcing Your Wood
gtnh.quest3095.name=Sourcing Your Wood
gtnh.quest3095.desc=When it comes to power from wood, your only options so far have been the wood itself and Charcoal. Both of these are low on energy per item, so you will need a lot of wood to have a decent EU/t output. How, then, can you easily get that much? There are two ways: the automated way, and the non-automated way.%n%nThe automated way can be done with one of several machines, but in LV you only have one option: the LV Crop Manager. It can automatically harvest crops in an area around it and, for this situation, the crop you want is one of several Bonsais. You can get them by planting saplings on cropsticks (there is a lot more information about how crops work in the Forestry and Multifarms page), and most types of saplings are equivalent to one another, although not all of them can be planted as crops. The ones that stand out are Spruce, which give a bit more wood than the others, and Oak, which give Apples alongside the usual wood and saplings, possibly useful for some chemistry later.%n%nThe non-automated way can be done earlier, and it only requires two things: an unbreakable Lumber Axe and trees with a lot of wood, like Sacred Oak, Redwood, or Rainforest Oak. This axe will chop down (most of) the trees and award you with stacks and stacks of wood, much faster than the automated way, but with more work. This process might be useful in the beginning, but you will have to automate the wood input at some point. %n%nComplete one of the tasks and get some wood to continue. 

# Quest.3096 - Faster Charcoal
gtnh.quest3096.name=Faster Charcoal
gtnh.quest3096.desc=Even if you have more wood, this won't help your power issues that much. Using it directly as fuel isn't going to do much for you as you move forward, and turning it into Charcoal will be very important. You have already built a Coke Oven, maybe more than one, but each one takes 90 seconds to produce one Charcoal, an abysmal rate. Unfortunately, there isn't any faster option in this tier, so you will have to build more of these ovens. How many, exactly?%n%nThere are many different goals you might want to go for, but a good metric for your power needs is a setup with 24 Coke Ovens. This number will create both Charcoal and Creosote Oil at a rate that will run two max-sized LP (Low Pressure) Railcraft Boilers, one solid and one liquid, with the quest for those coming right after this one. If you automate this entire setup, it will produce around 2 amps of MV, which are equivalent to 8 amps of LV, plenty of power for this tier and enough to advance you to the next one.%n%nAfter building these Coke Ovens, you will need to automate them. There are a few ways to do this, but one of the cheapest ones is to use Item Pipes, made with Tin for example, with a Conveyor Module in the wood chest/drawer to put the wood in the ovens, and then one Hopper below each oven, into more Item Pipes, to gather the Charcoal. The Creosote is a bit harder to extract, but you can do it with Tinkers' Faucets on the side of each Coke Oven, with a Wooden Fluid Pipe directly under the faucet. You will need to keep reactivating them with redstone, which means you'll also need a redstone clock (there's a block dedicated to this purpose, named Redstone Clock, from Extra Utilities).

# Quest.3097 - Two Big Ovens
gtnh.quest3097.name=Two Big Ovens
gtnh.quest3097.desc=With 24 Coke Ovens automated, you can sustain two big boilers endlessly. The boilers you want to build for this are specifically the Low Pressure Railcraft Boilers, made with Iron, each one as big as they can be, a 3x4x3 of the Boiler Tanks. These multiblocks are expensive, but you will have plenty of power and will consume all the Creosote from your Coke Ovens to keep them running permanently.%n%nThese boilers have a High Pressure variant, though, which need a lot more steel than their cheaper counterparts but can output a lot more Steam. If you somehow gathered a lot of stacks of Steel Ingots, you might think of attempting this, but keep in mind that your Coke Oven setup cannot sustain the input those heated behemoths require to keep running. The same goes for the Large Bronze Boiler, GregTech's own way of improving on your tiny boilers, but with two added problems: you can't produce Charcoal fast enough for it (the output speed of your setup is 3.75 seconds per Charcoal, the LBB needs one every 2 seconds), and it has a terrible efficiency for your Creosote, which means most of its power will be wasted. §6And perhaps, the LBB is MV-gated by circuit, compared to the boiler who is early-LV because of steel.§r%n%nHowever, surprise! The GT++ Semifluid Generators work, and they're very efficient with the Creosote. You can use a few of those coupled with a Large Bronze Boiler, but you will still run into the issue of not producing Charcoal fast enough unless you do something about it. You can choose this as an option and complete this quest, but it's a more "experimental" alternative.

# Quest.3098 - The Benzene Tier
gtnh.quest3098.name=The Benzene Tier
gtnh.quest3098.desc=Having walked into MV, you are soon going to be able to produce and consume Benzene. It's more efficient than burning the Charcoal in a boiler, but you will still need to provide a lot of wood to make sure you have consistent, abundant power. It's heavily recommended that you automate this wood input, if you haven't already, possibly with an MV Crop Manager instead of the LV one, or with the Crop Harvester from IC2. %n%nFor automation, you're still stuck with using bonsais, not regular trees. HV will provide a few options that don't need crops, but for now you might want to increase your crop stats by crossbreeding. Planting saplings on cropsticks creates 1/1/1 bonsais, which are much slower than their high-stat variants. If you want to invest in crops, you can later use the high stats to get more of a several dozen different items that crops can output, but you should start with Stickreed to develop your crop stats, not bonsais.%n%nDon't throw away your saplings, either! They will be useful later on, so save up as many as you can.

# Quest.3099 - Biodiesel Alternative
gtnh.quest3099.name=Biodiesel Alternative
gtnh.quest3099.desc=Trees are not the only source of power for the renewable enjoyer, though. You can continue to expand your wood production to sustain yourself, but you can also avoid the Charcoal business altogether! There are some naturally-sourced, energetic oils that can be processed into a greener alternative of what oil pumping can lead you to, in this tier. While crude oil turns into Diesel, this oil turns into Biodiesel! %n%nIn general, Biodiesel has less power per bucket than Diesel, which is its main drawback, to compensate for the renewable sources. You could source both of them from plants, but Oilberries are very slow compared to the option you might use, Rape flowers or Goldfish. They are an excellent source of Seed Oil or Fish Oil, but they are also IC2 crops, so their output scales with their stats. %n%nBetween the two, Goldfish have a faster fluid extraction recipe, so they are often recommended for that reason, although it's not a dealbreaker. It's recommended that you get high-statted crops if you want to follow this route, although it is not a necessity, because there are other options that never go into these IC2 crops.%n%nHow many options are there, really? There are many, but they can be divided into 3 categories, and that's what the quest tasks focus on: IC2 crops in a Crop Manager, regular crops in a Multifarm or automatic fishing in a fish trap. All of them are sources of a biological oil, either Seed Oil or Fish Oil, which can then be processed into Biodiesel.

# Quest.3100 - The Two Ethanols
gtnh.quest3100.name=The Two Ethanols
gtnh.quest3100.desc=The other fluid that mixes in with one of the natural oils to create Biodiesel can be one of two siblings: Methanol and Ethanol. They're very similar, both alcohols composed of carbon atoms surrounded by hydrogen ones, with one OH at the end. They often come from the same source (for example, running Wood Vinegar or Biomass through a Distillation Tower), but they also have some differences. To produce them from simpler elements in a Chemical Reactor, you'll need MV tier, which is where you are at. %n%nCheck NEI for all the recipes you can use for either of these. You only need one, so choose which of the quest tasks you want to complete. The one you're likely going to produce is Methanol.

# Quest.3101 - Extracting the Oil
gtnh.quest3101.name=Extracting the Oil
gtnh.quest3101.desc=Each option generates a different amount of oil, but this should be the limiting factor in your Biodiesel production regardless of which you choose. This step is always slow, for better or for worse, so your job is add more plants or more fish to the system. You might get byproducts, especially with fish, so deal with them accordingly. %n%nYou can upgrade the setup you have when you get to the next tier, or switch what you're using later. Either way, get some oil.

# Quest.3102 - Biological Diesel
gtnh.quest3102.name=Biological Diesel
gtnh.quest3102.desc=Reacting the three chemicals from the steps before with each other, you get a highly energetic fluid that is, for most purposes, equivalent to Diesel. To burn it for power, you cannot use Steam or Gas Turbines, but instead the Combustion Generators that Diesel also uses. They are reasonably efficient, generating 90% of the EU shown in NEI per bucket of fuel, although Biodiesel has a lower fuel value than either Benzene or Diesel, but not by much. Besides the generators, you also need a big enough fuel input per tick to sustain your base, so make sure to expand your setup enough to fuel all of your other automations.%n%nBiodiesel isn't the only thing you get from this process, though. As a side product, you also get Glycerol. Do not throw this away, it will prove itself useful when making epoxy resin, and possibly in other setups, to save you some work at a later time. When using singleblock Chemical Reactors, the recipe will stop if the Glycerol output is full, a situation in which a super tank will surely come in handy. %n%nWith that said, HV holds a big upgrade to this fuel that you might want to invest in. Keep progressing to check it out!%n%n 

# Quest.3103 - Advanced Coke Oven
gtnh.quest3103.name=Advanced Coke Oven
gtnh.quest3103.desc=Your power needs quadrupled since the last tier, and it's likely that you're not getting Charcoal fast enough. Instead of adding even more Coke Ovens, why not build an upgraded version of them?%n%nThe caveat is that you won't keep producing Creosote alongside the Charcoal from now on. It makes for decent power in the appropriate generators, and you might have already used it to produce Lubricant. Despite that, you can still get Creosote from processing in the next steps of this questline, so you can still get it if you need it. With that out of the way, let's move on to the Advanced Coke Oven (ACO).%n%nHow is it made? The ACO needs a lot more steps than the normal Coke Ovens, steps centered around Nether materials, cooked in the EBF and then cooled down. The cooling part is normally the Vacuum Freezer's job, as you will see later in progression, but you can't build it yet; because of that, you'll have to use IC2 coolant to finish the bricks used in the ACO. Once you've crafted all the blocks needed for this, you can put it together and start it up, to see what's different from before.%n%nThe speed of this new one is 1 Charcoal per second, or the equivalent to 90 Coke Ovens. The cost of this is the loss of the Creosote, and also that it needs fuel to work, making it so approaximately 1/16 of your Charcoal is lost in this step. Fortunately, you can automate it with item pipes, and the EnderIO conduits make it even simpler. Input wood, input charcoal, output charcoal.%n%nMake one of these multis to continue. Be warned that you might need more!

# Quest.3104 - Pyrolyse Oven
gtnh.quest3104.name=Pyrolyse Oven
gtnh.quest3104.desc=Some setups really demand space in your base to work properly. You might have thought that when you finished the Coke Oven automation, but there's also an option in this tier that respects that need for speed by just being a gigantic multiblock: the Pyrolyse Oven.%n%nIn essence, it's the original GregTech large-scale wood processor. It is a massive structure, probably bigger than any other multi you've build before, but it uses simple materials like bronze and steel. If you're able to just throw stacks of those at a controller, you can put this behemoth together and enjoy an alternative to the Advanced Coke Oven that has some extra benefits. Unlike any of the other ovens, this one runs on EU, so you need to route your power back here to process the wood you're feeding it. %n%nWhat makes the Pyro valuable? It outputs a fluid alongside the Charcoal, which you can process for extra power and/or byproducts. Look at NEI to see all the alternatives available to you, this multi can usually output several different fluids, but only one at a time, decided by the circuit inside it. The one to choose at this time is Wood Tar, the same fluid you're extracting from the Charcoal. You get a small constant bonus from having built a Pyro, which is really nice.%n%nHowever, the Pyro uses coils in a similar way to the EBF, and those coils affect the time each recipe takes: if you're using Cupronickel Coils, the recipe time is actually 2x what NEI says! This might be too slow for your needs, so make sure you check how much Charcoal you're getting from here. Kanthal Coils are available in MV, using the IC2 Coolant instead of the Vacuum Freezer.%n%nYou can also boost your Pyro by providing Nitrogen. There are separate recipes for that in NEI.

# Quest.3105 - Large Steel Boiler
gtnh.quest3105.name=Large Steel Boiler
gtnh.quest3105.desc=Direct Charcoal consumption is also improved, if you want to go that way. The second Large Boiler is made out of Steel, but needs HV circuits, which you can make in this tier by using Polyethylene in the circuit boards. It generates steam at a speed equivalent to 1000 EU/t at 100% fuel efficiency for that steam, which you can't reach with the inefficient Steam Turbines available to you. It also needs two ACOs, but it skips any further processing, at an additional cost of heavy pollution that you'll have to deal with in some way.%n%nThis is the most "spammable" setup you can make. There are no further upgrades to the Large Boilers that accept these cheap fuels (the next boilers only accept some more complicated ones), but you can wallshare these to increase the energy input into your processing. The biggest problem, as usual, is transporting the steam to prevent big energy losses across long stretches of cable. This is not the best option, but it can be used.

# Quest.3106 - Wood Tar
gtnh.quest3106.name=Wood Tar
gtnh.quest3106.desc=Benzene cannot be extracted directly from Charcoal. To get to it, you need to process the extracted fluid, called Wood Tar. In the past, this was a very slow step, which forced players to spam Fluid Extractors to keep up with the other parts of their Benzene line, but it's a lot faster now. Regardless, you still need more than one Fluid Extractor for each machine used in the step after this one, if you are using LV machines here. %n%nSince it's an LV recipe, you can overclock it with an MV machine, but you'll waste some EU that way (each recipe will cost twice as much EU). To continue, craft either 2 LV Fluid Extractors or 1 MV one.

# Quest.3107 - The Most Powerful Biodiesel 
gtnh.quest3107.name=The Most Powerful Biodiesel 
gtnh.quest3107.desc=If you've been working with renewable diesels before, you might want to upgrade them further. Instead of just duplicating your existing setup, you can upgrade Biodiesel to Cetane-Boosted Diesel (CBD), with a specific additive called Tetranitromethane (TNM). You'll get more bang for your buck if you upgrade to this fuel, instead of just making more Biodiesel, since it has 3x more EU per bucket, and the TNM is needed in small quantities. Before you start working on the new setup, though, it's important that you increase the amount of Seed/Fish Oil you're making, and in turn the items that turn into those oils. %n%nAs before, you can use IC2 crops, regular crops/trees or fishing. For IC2 crops, you can use the Multifarm set to IC2 crop mode, which needs HV-gated Uranium Electrum Tubes but automated more than 1000 crops while being very conservative with power and fertilizer, or the HV Crop Manager. For normal crops/trees, use the EnderIO Farming Station, also unlocked in HV. For fishing, you don't have new tools, you can only add more Fish Catchers or use Goldfish IC2 crops if you're oriented that way.%n%nTo complete this quest, make a Multifarm, a Farming Station or some Fish Catchers.

# Quest.3108 - Trees Growing Faster
gtnh.quest3108.name=Trees Growing Faster
gtnh.quest3108.desc=No matter which way you used to get wood, you can simplify it. There's nothing much simpler than just pulling out more and more wood from a multiblock that doesn't even grow trees! That's what the Tree Growth Simulator does, with a special input: saws. This multi can replace the bonsais that were used for wood automation, however it is only available in IV. You have two further options in the mean time:%n%nTo continue using bonsais, in case you have gotten good stats on them, you can use the HV version of the Crop Manager, or the multiblock version, the Multifarm. This multi is special because it needs Uranium Rods, which are HV due to needing Eyes of Ender, but it has a massive range to harvest crops, being able to work with 1000+ of them, while only consuming 6 ULV amps when built correctly. It also hydrates and fertilizes automatically, and is much more efficient with the Fertilizer than its competition. Compared to the Crop Manager, it only loses out on the extra drops per harvest.%n%nOther than these two options, you can also grow and harvest trees normally with the EnderIO Farmer, which is a more typical tree automation machine. It's HV-locked like and it's simple, reliable and only needs a bit of power to get the wood you need, at a pretty fast rate. Ideally you want to use an unbreakable lumber axe with a tree type that produces a lot of logs (spruce is decent). To crank out a lot of wood you can then use sprinklers with water or a world accelerator.

# Quest.3109 - Sapling Power
gtnh.quest3109.name=Sapling Power
gtnh.quest3109.desc=Wood has been a big part of your power generation, and you might have even used other plants or fish for oil. Even if that's true, there is a constant output from your trees that has been left unused all this time: the saplings! No matter which tree you chose to automate, you are surely stockpiling the saplings matching that tree, since there's little that is really useful to do with them. At this point, though, you can set up a decent Biomass setup.%n%nTo clarify, Biomass is just a fluid made from plant stuff. It doesn't need to be saplings, but that's most likely something you have a lot of lying around. On top of that, there are multiple types of Biomass, one of them called Fermented Biomass, which is very similar but different, and the recommended path for you to take, since it needs less steps than the alternatives and gets you to the DT recipe just fine.%n%nAfter this processing line is finished, you will have a lot of new chemicals automated that you won't have from Wood Tar alone. If you are already processing Wood Vinegar, you will have several repeat outputs, though. That said, if you complete this line, you will get Ethanol + Methanol and Ammonia, which make the Cetane-Boosted Diesel process much easier. All of these lines interact with each other, and you can get bigger and bigger returns if you automate several at once!%n%nFor now, focus on putting together the machines needed to get from Saplings to Fermented Biomass. You will need a Compressor, a Pulverizer and a Pyrolyse Oven for this route.

# Quest.3110 - Fractioned Benzene
gtnh.quest3110.name=Fractioned Benzene
gtnh.quest3110.desc=One of the most important steps is to remove the limitation you had when distilling. Wood Tar turns into Benzene? That's not how it should be, there's much more to get from that tar than what you've been extracting from it. To keep the rest, you need more space in the distillation process, or, more specifically, more height. Each of the fluids that can be separated from within the tar will stick at a different height level, sitting on top of all the others that are more dense than itself.%n%nBasically, you need a multiblock, instead of a singleblock. The Distillation Tower you will need for this recipe has to be at least 6 blocks tall, with 1 input plus 5 outputs. Out of it, you will get Benzene, Toluene and Phenol, which are all viable gases for power alongside being very useful for progression (Toluene for compressing with TNT and moving past HV, Phenol for crafting circuits in the next tier and other chemical lines). You will also get various types of Dimethylbenzene. For now the only one of interest is 1,2-Dimethylbenzene which is a part of the PBI line in IV. Though even that is unfortunately of little use to you right now. You also get Creosote for your Lubricant needs, or a little extra power.%n%nThe Distillation Tower will continue consuming Wood Tar, even if one or more outputs are full: it'll just void the rest! Other than Dimethylbenzene, everything else can be used for power, so try not to waste those things. 

# Quest.3111 - Creosote's Work
gtnh.quest3111.name=Creosote's Work
gtnh.quest3111.desc=Your old pal, Creosote Oil, is back in the game! That's right, you can get it automatically from Charcoal processing again, as you did with the first Coke Ovens, and what you can do with it is about the same. The two main purposes it has are power generation and Lubricant, which you will want to use in Cutting Machines, and will also be required in some later multiblocks like the Large Combustion Engine and the Multiblock Miner. Using a Brewery, you can add some Redstone to quickly convert this oil to Lubricant and keep it in stock for whatever machine or craft needs it.%n%nAlternatively, you can get a bit of extra power from this. The fuel value per bucket is much lower than the big three, but it still has an interesting use. When the semifluid generators were broken, and the Creosote wasn't usable in them, there were setups using two max-size LP Railcraft boilers to turn the amount you get from one DT into the EU needed to run it, making that step completely free in terms of power. There were some fine details, such as the Steam Turbines needing to all be LV for the fuel efficiency, but it'd be easier to use semifluid generators from the start. Either way, you can at least remove the EU cost from the DT from the equation, if you wish to.

# Quest.3112 - Phenol's Width
gtnh.quest3112.name=Phenol's Width
gtnh.quest3112.desc=This one is not as specialized as Toluene is. It's also more likely that you will be producing it in a Chemical Reactor, or working around it with recipes, if you choose not to use Oil or Benzene for some reason. You're here, though, so you have all of the possibilities, and all of the advantages of skipping through steps in several important chemical lines that accept Phenol, one of the first being epoxy resin. If you check NEI, you can more easily see where this chemical can come in handy.%n%nIt is true, though, that it isn't as required in HV as Toluene is. Since both of them are good power options alongside Benzene, it's preferable that you burn this one for power between the two, if you have to. In the best situation, you won't need to, but it's also acceptable to burn all of the Benzene and some Phenol, while the Toluene gets converted into its gelled form to make several stacks of TNT. Don't discredit the amount of power you can get from this.

# Quest.3113 - Toluene's Power
gtnh.quest3113.name=Toluene's Power
gtnh.quest3113.desc=Trinitrotoluene. Shorthand, that's TNT, or one of the most popular types of explosive there is. Not only is it popular, but it's a centerpiece of a special type of GTNH crafting: implosion compressing! There are other types of explosives available, but TNT is the best for this purpose.%n%nThat's all fine and dandy, but unfortunately it is not optional. To get past HV, you will need Titanium, and the most reasonable way to accomplish that is to get it from ores found in the Moon, which will need a rocket made of very compressed plates, courtesy of a few stacks of said TNT. To source it, you will need a lot of Toluene, and from there you can make a choice: make regular TNT, or add Nitric Acid to the mix and come out with Industrial TNT, a more powerful version that can, for the most part, craft more items than the cheaper TNT. Some of the renewable powergen processes can output Ammonia, which makes Nitric Acid much easier to produce, so keep that in mind.%n%nToluene, plus TNT or iTNT is what you need. The rocket will thank you later.

# Quest.3114 - Further Charcoal Distillation
gtnh.quest3114.name=Further Charcoal Distillation
gtnh.quest3114.desc=The Distillation Tower you've recently unlocked can bring forth many, many more outputs than what you've done so far. If you look at NEI, you might see that there are other Charcoal-related fluids that have recipes in this multi, and this is the time to work with them: doing it all in singleblock Distlleries would be very wasteful.%n%nThe most important part about getting these fluids is the Pyrolyse Oven. If you haven't made one, it's highly recommended that you make at least one. You can upgrade both the energy hatch and the coils used in it to keep it up to speed with everything else, no need to build more than one. Aside from fulfilling the purpose of the Coke Oven, to cook Wood into Charcoal, it gives the choice of which of several fluids it also outputs as it does the processing. Most of the options are potentially useful, but a complete Benzene setup will prefer Charcoal Byproducts because they are, essentially, the complete product.%n%nATTENTION: This setup is technically HV, but it's quite expensive. It's fine if you move to EV first before you build this. It is in no way required to progress in HV.%n%nWith Charcoal Byproducts, the full setup involves DTing that into Wood Tar, Wood Vinegar and Wood Gas, and then DTing all of those into their respective outputs. With one tower for each, you will end up with a quad DT setup, very expensive overall in terms of Stainless Steel, but with huge savings compared to making 4 separate ones. Keep in mind, however, that they will not all have the same height. Additionally, Wood Gas is not as valuable as the other two (although it is a decent Ethylene source), so it's also a good idea to make 2 of the 4 DTs process that, and burn the Wood Gas for the little power it can provide.%n%nAs a final note, the towers do process things slowly. Add Distilleries, if you wish, to get specific outputs.

# Quest.3115 - Vinegar into Acetone
gtnh.quest3115.name=Vinegar into Acetone
gtnh.quest3115.desc=From Wood Vinegar, one of the useful outputs you can walk away with is Acetone. It's not very easy to craft, needing Calcium Dust and Acetic Acid, which needs Methanol or Hydrogen... instead of all that, you can get it right here, alongside some of the other chemicals in this family tree. %n%nWhat is it for, though? Simple: Epoxy Resin, Cetane-Boosted Diesel, Raw Gasoline and maybe some up-and-coming glue. Want it? Get it, it'll surely prove useful.

# Quest.3116 - Direct Ethylene
gtnh.quest3116.name=Direct Ethylene
gtnh.quest3116.desc=Wood Gas has a big portion of barely useful outputs, but also some hidden gems. The hardest one to get, arguably, is Ethylene, since it needs automated Sulfuric Acid alongside the Ethanol you're already getting. DTing Wood Gas is the main way to get Ethylene directly, without worrying about the acid, when it comes to renewable power. This make Polyethylene, an important plastic you've already worked with at this point.%n%nThe caveat is, of course, the small amount that you get in this recipe. Whether or not you set this process up is your choice, but it's generally useful, especially if your main Ethanol source is Wood Vinegar. 

# Quest.3117 - No Benzene Yet
gtnh.quest3117.name=No Benzene Yet
gtnh.quest3117.desc=This questbook page is supposed to explain the Benzene powergen line, but you might have noticed that you haven't made any Benzene yet. That's because the recipe path to get it from Charcoal has an MV recipe, and you can't just skip straight to MV with the small amount of steam you were using in the Bronze Age. %n%nThere are also other paths for renewable power in this page. They have similar sources, or the same source, but different processing lines, and the entire thing looks like a tree branch, with many different ways in which you can go. The Carbon Monoxide path is one example of this, and there are many more to come in the future.%n%nRegardless of which path you chose to get power from your Charcoal, you can now sustain an EBF comfortably and get power more efficiently. It's recommended that you move away from steam in the next tier, because you will need to transport too much of it to produce good amounts of MV power. Fortunately, you won't need steam at all!

# Quest.3118 - Green Nitric Acid
gtnh.quest3118.name=Green Nitric Acid
gtnh.quest3118.desc=One half of TNM is Nitric Acid, which has more paths to reach it than can be listed here. It's basically Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Oxygen merged together, and many compounds made from these things can lead you to Nitric Acid. How you get this is up to you, but it might be a lot easier if you already automated some Distillation Tower setups for other renewable resources.%n%nLet me explain. Nitric Acid can be made directly from Ammonia and Oxygen. O2 has many sources, and you should have already automated it, but Ammonia is harder to get: you either make it from Nitrogen Oxide and Dioxide, or you skip all that with a Fermented Biomass DT, which outputs Ammonia directly. That is the fastest way, if you already made that setup, otherwise you'll need to chain several reactions together.

# Quest.3119 - Green Ethenone
gtnh.quest3119.name=Green Ethenone
gtnh.quest3119.desc=The other half of TNM is Ethenone. Once again, DTs can make this easier for you, but Ethenone is pretty simple to figure out: either Acetic Acid or Acetone can make it, both of which are DT outputs, but Acetic Acid also needs Sulfuric Acid to make it. %n%nAcetone is easier, but either way works. One important thing to understand is that you only need a small, tiny amount of Ethenone when compared to other chemicals. When working with Biodiesel, 200L of Ethenone are enough for 9000L of CBD, which is equal to 9 million EU at 100% fuel efficiency. With that consideration, each bucket of Ethenone corresponds to 45M EU! Quite powerful, if I do say so myself. %n%nClearly, your bottleneck will be the Biodiesel and, in turn, the Seed/Fish Oil.

# Quest.3120 - Green Cetane-Boosted Diesel
gtnh.quest3120.name=Green Cetane-Boosted Diesel
gtnh.quest3120.desc=Tetranitromethane is the additive you need to turn Biodiesel into Cetane-Boosted Diesel. Each bucket of the first turns into 0.9 buckets of the second, but if you look at the EU values per bucket of both, 320k turns into 900k EU, discounting 5.7k EU from the craft, a huge upgrade in power generation. The TNM only costs some thousand EU, the main difficulty is automating the input of all the materials, which shouldn't be too hard at this stage of progression. %n%nThe power density of this fuel is great, but it doesn't mean you'll have enough power to get to EV. What really matters here is the amount of plants or fish you can provide, since all the other items and fluids are basically additives when compared to the amount of oil you need. It's hard to match the speed at which crude oil can be obtained, but you can bring forth a lot of Seed/Fish Oil if you increase the size of those setups.%n%nThere are more possibilities for CBD in the future, if you want to move towards those.

# Quest.3121 - Fermented Biomass
gtnh.quest3121.name=Fermented Biomass
gtnh.quest3121.desc=After this biomass leaves the Pyro, you can input it straight into a DT and it will be separated into its component parts. This is one of the tallest towers that you can make with fully renewable powergen and, sadly, not all outputs are useful. However, you'll still get a nice bang for your buck, if you manage to not get lost in NEI in the middle of all this chemistry.%n%nThe following quests will explain some important uses for the outputs of this DT recipe. First, however, you need to get it going, which means you need a lot of Fermented Biomass and a tall enough tower to process it. There is one caveat that you might run into as you try to speed up your machines, which is that saplings don't come fast enough! You can work around this by throwing more plant stuff into the Compressor, and how you solve this is really up to you and what you have.

# Quest.3122 - Free For All Fertilizer
gtnh.quest3122.name=Free For All Fertilizer
gtnh.quest3122.desc=You might have heard of the Fertilia crop, which can easily automate the Fertilizer input for your crops, if you're using them. Why bother, though, when you're already getting it from your DT? That's right, you will also be able to automate fertilizing alongside everything else, which is very important for high-statted crops, making all the inputs (energy, water, fertilizer) automated without any outside inputs. Pretty neat, huh?%n%nThat said, you might not be using IC2 crops at all. In that case, you can electrolyze it, and you'll get a lot of free Carbon and Calcite Dust, which you'll certainly use in future chemistry. You can also use the CO2 Gas from the DT to get Carbon, I guess? It's not very useful.

# Quest.3123 - Methane Stinks
gtnh.quest3123.name=Methane Stinks
gtnh.quest3123.desc=The output you'll get the most of, in the Fermented Biomass DT, is Methane. 6/10 of the input amount will become Methane, and this makes for the best choice for powering your powergen, even if other outputs can also serve as fuel options. It's important to remember that Methane is used in several important chemical lines, such as PTFE and Silicone Rubber, but you'll get much more of it than you need for those purposes.%n%nThe Methane you get from one DT can power it 4 times. Using 1/4 of your power there, you can fuel the singleblock machines you're using, and the wood automation source as well if you feel like it. Regardless, this setup should fuel itself just fine.

# Quest.3124 - Ethanols Here
gtnh.quest3124.name=Ethanols Here
gtnh.quest3124.desc=Ethanol and Methanol are two different chemicals, but they are both outputs from DTing Fermented Biomass or Wood Vinegar. Between the two, you can make Ethylene (and then Polyethylene, by adding Sulfuric Acid and Oxygen), Biodiesel, Dense Hydrazine (GT++ rocket fuel, it's very powerful in IV, try it), some chemicals for HOG (EV fuel from crude oil), and many other things such as Chloromethane. For future processing lines, you're going to want to have these stocked up. %n%nThey are both also power sources, if you end up with full super tanks. Their fuel values aren't the best, with Ethanol at 192k and Methanol at 84k, but they are perfectly capable of fueling your powergen setups, leaving your best fuels free to power your main base. Even if you're using them for Biodiesel and Polyethylene at the same time, it's quite likely that you'll have leftovers. If you have the choice to use any of the two in a recipe, choose Methanol, since Ethanol has a lot more EU per bucket to give.%n%n(Also note that you get almost no Ethanol from Wood Vinegar compared to Methanol. On the Fermented Biomass side, the amounts are the same.)

# Quest.3125 - Skipped into Ammonia
gtnh.quest3125.name=Skipped into Ammonia
gtnh.quest3125.desc=This one is almost a flex, at times, depending on your future plans. Ammonia is one of the most power-intensive early chemicals to produce, from Nitrogen and Oxygen, with a slow HV recipe compared to most others being produced quickly. It is used very often, in various stages of progression, often to make Nitric Acid that is used for Industrial TNT, Cetane-Boosted Diesel and other products. From Fermented Biomass, you can get it directly, although only one tenth of the amount of biomass used, 1000 mL to 100 mL of Ammonia.%n%nThe rate at which you're going to get this, just from one HV DT, isn't very fast. DTs are slow by design, and the ratio for Ammonia isn't great, so you can accumulate it if you leave the setup running for a while, but you won't be able to feed it into multiple automations that require it unless you upgrade the DT or make more of them, both of which are easy to do later on. Alternatively, you can choose to void the other outputs and work with singleblock Distilleries instead, but this depends on the rate at which you're inputting saplings. %n%nTo note, Ammonia is required to make Cetane-Boosted Diesel, which you can make from Biodiesel. You can great a good mileage for that just from one Fermented Biomass DT.

# Quest.3126 - Sodium Hydroxide
gtnh.quest3126.name=Sodium Hydroxide
gtnh.quest3126.desc=The Biodiesel needs a bit of powder magic. In reality, this powder is another chemical that this chain uses, Sodium Hydroxide, NaOH. The bad part is that you can't continue without making this, but there's a boon to this: you only need a little bit of it, around 1 dust to make 45 buckets of Biodiesel. %n%nUnlike in the other steps, you can probably get away with batch crafting this instead of automating it, and still have consistent power from this fuel line. One stack of this dust is enough to make more than 100 million EU's worth of power, as long as the other fluids are automated. Given that, you can forget about it for a long time, but not forever. If you choose to not automate it yet, make sure you check it from time to time.%n%n(This can be automated from Salt Water, which can be automated from Tearstalks, a specific IC2 crop. You get Chlorine and Hydrogen as well.)

# Quest.3127 - Upgrading Your Benzene
gtnh.quest3127.name=Upgrading Your Benzene
gtnh.quest3127.desc=Having moved another tier, you have unlocked another fuel upgrade! Luckily for you, it uses simple inputs, although the place in which you craft it is more expensive than usual. This time around, the bigger expense is by far the processing multiblock, and you will need several stacks of Titanium to put it together. %n%nGiven as much, this is not a task for the very start of EV. It's recommended that you automate your Titanium processing line before you attempt this, because the Chemical Plant is going to grind your manual patience otherwise. If you already have a lot of that, everything else should be much simpler.%n%n(You will need a lot more than a stack. This is just to get you started.)

# Quest.3128 - CBD Into Steam
gtnh.quest3128.name=CBD Into Steam
gtnh.quest3128.desc=There are no more Diesel-related upgrades for the CBD. To continue using Combustion Generators, or the LCE, you can only make your setup bigger or upgrade energy hatches. There is, however, a more power-dense fuel that uses CBD in its recipe, but there's a catch: it's a solid fuel, to be used in steam boilers, which gives it advantages and disadvantages.%n%nEverything from this quest onwards is about those solid fuels. There are two versions, one with additional inputs over the other, and they both follow the same logic: they need to be converted to Steam, which is hard to transport, convert into EU and basically require the EV and IV Large Steam Boilers. However, the combination of these fuels and those boilers is much, much more fuel efficient than before, if you are willing to face the additional challenges in this kind of setup.%n%nHow does it generally go? If you already have CBD, you can get power from it by putting it directly in Combustion Generators. In this line, though, you need to automate Fuel Binder, add blocks of Charcoal, Coal or Coal Coke and then put the Super Fuel in a Titanium or Tungstensteel Large Boiler, where you get Superheated Steam. After that, you need a HP Steam Turbine multi, followed by a regular Steam Turbine multi, and the setup is complete. %n%nIf you want to continue, then you'll need at least one Titanium Large Boiler. Build one. 

# Quest.3129 - Industrial Coke Oven
gtnh.quest3129.name=Industrial Coke Oven
gtnh.quest3129.desc=Your EV endeavors might push you into a GT++ multiblock, despite most of those being IV-tier. This happens because the special alloys used to put them together need to be crafted in an Alloy Blast Smelter, which is IV, but the Industrial Coke Oven (ICO) does not!%n%nWhat does it do? It's in the name, it's a really fast Coke Oven. So fast, in fact, that it can replace a few dozen Pyrolyse Ovens. It actually takes its recipes from that multi, so you also get the additional fluid, such as Charcoal Byproducts, alongside the greatly increased processing speed. The caveat is that this multi needs both Titanium and Tungsten, although only a small amount of the latter. You can get that much from processing End Stone Dust, Ender Goo or Moon Dust. %n%nYou can also choose between two types of casings. One of them does 12x parallels and the other does 24x parallels, which means the multi can do that amount of recipes at the same time per craft, if it receives enough power to do so. Since they're both quite cheap, you should use the better casings.

# Quest.3130 - Mass Distilled Water
gtnh.quest3130.name=Mass Distilled Water
gtnh.quest3130.desc=Water is completely free, that much is obvious. Distilled Water, though? It's the same input, but it needs a machine to process it into this version, and you best not choose singleblock Distilleries to do this, because they are incredibly slow and will never keep up with your demands.%n%nThe obvious option is a Distillation Tower. The less obvious option is a Steam Turbine multi, which outputs Distilled Water that is supposedly piped back to where the steam is made. However, there are several steam producers that use regular water, so you can try that? The DT is the simplest and most direct option, though. 3-high is the minimum, so you have to build it like that. It doesn't need a lot of power, it will fill up a tank of any size over time since the water input is completely free.%n%nTo prevent it from running continuously, though, here's a neat trick, in case you haven't done it already: take the output hatch on the second layer, where the Distilled Water comes from, and put it directly above the DT controller. Then, put a Fluid Detector Cover on the bottom side of the hatch and a Machine Controller Cover on the top side of the controller, so that the covers are facing each other. Set the controller cover to "Disable with Redstone", and the DT will stop after the fluid tank you've chosen is full. When it gets full, the output hatch will get stuck with some water, and it will send a redstone signal that stops the DT.

# Quest.3131 - Nitric And Sulfuric Acid
gtnh.quest3131.name=Nitric And Sulfuric Acid
gtnh.quest3131.desc=Sourcing these two should be easy at this point. Overall, the easiest option for Sulfuric Acid is oil processing, but you can also make it from Sulfur Dust, which is so very common from ore processing.%n%nNitric Acid is a bit more convoluted, but you might have already automated it, since it's needed for Cetane-Boosted Diesel. Ammonia and Oxygen can make it, or Nitrogen Dioxide instead of Ammonia. You won't be able to do it in a single step, but a small line of Chemical Reactor, or their multiblock equivalent, will do it for you.

# Quest.3132 - Titanium Chemical Plant
gtnh.quest3132.name=Titanium Chemical Plant
gtnh.quest3132.desc=This is the difficult part in the whole process. The multi in which Nitrobenzene is crafted is the Exxonmobil Chemical Plant, also known as the Chemplant, and it is a gigantic 7x7x7 structure with 4 separate upgradable parts to it. Even worse, the outer structure uses multiblock Machine Casings, making the DT look cheap by comparison, and the inside needs a lot of the casings used to craft single blocks.%n%nThe difference between those is that the tier of the outer structure that you need is mentioned in the recipe you want to craft, and the tier of the inner structure is generally related to the EU/t of the recipe, minus one tier. This is because, like the EBF and the LCR, you can use 2 energy hatches, so this HV recipe can be made with MV energy hatches. Since the inner structure's tier decides the max tier of the hatches used in the Chemplant, you can make it out of MV machine casings, which use Aluminium.%n%nThe outer structure will still need many stacks of Titanium, so this is where most of your effort will go. Good luck.

# Quest.3133 - Nitrobenzene
gtnh.quest3133.name=Nitrobenzene
gtnh.quest3133.desc=With the Chemplant finished, you can slap in the necessary hatches and automate this fuel easily. The Titanium gate really is the main obstacle to this improvement, since you can more than triple the power your Benzene can make with some cheap additions to it!%n%nAs usual, the cost of building the setup will pay off over time. In this case, it'll happen even faster than usual, given how cheap the setup is. Benzene doesn't go anywhere beyond this point, but you can grab this final upgrade and make a lot out of it. Check out the multiblock Gas Turbines, and add a good turbine into them, made of a material like Manyullyn or Shadow Metal. %n%nAs a side note, Nitrobenzene shares an upgrade with Cetane-Boosted Diesel. They can both be used to make Super Fuels, which require more processing but are even more powerful, in terms of EU for the inputs given. They are finicky, but pack quite the punch. If you want to keep going, there are quests for that as well, unlocked after you finish this one.

# Quest.3134 - Coal Or Charcoal
gtnh.quest3134.name=Coal Or Charcoal
gtnh.quest3134.desc=The Super Fuels are blocks of burnable material, like Coal Blocks, which they need in their crafting recipe. It doesn't have to be Coal, though: you can do Coal, Charcoal or Coal Coke, and all of them make the same amount of Super Fuel. However, the amount of fluid fuel used changes based on which kind of block you used, which poses a problem.%n%n(We will ignore Lignite Coal, since it is by far the worst option. If you want to use it, dealing with the efficiency problem is up to you.)%n%nThe problem is this: the amount of EU you save by choosing Charcoal instead of the other two is less than the amount of EU that the additional fuel can make. Basically, the most efficient option is Coal Coke, then Coal, then Charcoal. The easiest option to automate is certainly Charcoal, which means this is a choice between ease of automation and fuel efficiency. Even if you use Charcoal, you will still get more EU from the final fuel than what you used as input.%n%nCoal can be automated too, though! There are many ways to do this, but the most popular way of automating items that aren't renewable by default is usually by using either IC2 crops or Forestry bees, both of which have their own renewable Coal. If you never made progress in either of those, keep in mind that they need time and effort to give you good results, but if you have, then they are great options to make this fuel even more efficiently. Naturally, you will then turn it into Coal Coke with Pyrolyse Ovens, ACOs or ICOs.%n%nStock up on either Charcoal or Coal Coke blocks to continue.

# Quest.3135 - Normal Or Magic
gtnh.quest3135.name=Normal Or Magic
gtnh.quest3135.desc=There are two different Super Fuels, not just one. The regular Solid Super Fuel (SSF) has a heat value of 100k, whereas the Magic Solid Super Fuel (MSSF) has it as 150k, or 50% more EU per block. As you can guess, the second one is more valuable, and worth it to make, but it requires even more processing than the first one.%n%nThe good part is, you don't really need lots of Thaumcraft progression. You barely need any, if at all, because there are many ways to make the Magic Fuel Binder and the block itself, including some that don't use any Thaumcraft items. There are so many options that this quest won't ask for a specific one, and it is once again up to you to decide which to choose, if you choose the magic fuel at all. As a tip, Alumentum is not mineable like Diamonds, but it can be automated by throwing Charcoal Dust at a Cauldron, and it has a higher burn value than the inputs. Additionally, for Coal Coke, only the Alumentum option is available.%n%nBasically, the SSF has 3 steps: craft the binder, craft the solid block and craft the fluid. The MSSF has more steps: craft the binder, upgrade it to magic binder, craft the solid block, craft the fluid and then finish with the extra items. Choose your own path.

# Quest.3136 - Super Fuel And Boiling
gtnh.quest3136.name=Super Fuel And Boiling
gtnh.quest3136.desc=If you've gotten this far, you should be about ready to produce Steam at an alarming rate from this hyper-efficient fuel. Unlike the Combustion Generators and Gas Turbines, though, you need more multis in front of your Large Boiler. Since it outputs Superheated Steam, you will need two turbines: the first one outputs EU and regular Steam, and the second one takes it in and outputs more EU and water, to be reused in the boiler.%n%nThe multis don't do anything by themselves, they need a turbine inside the controller to run them, and the turbine's size and material decide what their preferred flow rate is, and the EU/t at that rate. Good materials in EV are Shadow Metal (from Thaumcraft) and Manuyllyn, in IV you can use Oriharukon. Steam Turbine multis usually have a lower EU/t value than Gas Turbine ones, which means that you might have to make more of each kind of multi. This depends on the amount of boilers you are using, which tier of boiler and also whether or not you are using loose mode (check the Steam Turbine quest for more details).%n%nFlow rates when using Steam are very high, as you can imagine. You will need huge GT pipes if you use that mode of transportation, but there is a better way: AE2 P2P tunnels, set to fluid mode, can teleport fluids from one multi to the next without caring for high flow rates. With all that taken care of, all you need is an EV Buffered Dynamo Hatch for each turbine, and your setup is complete!

# Quest.3137 - Bet On The Distillus
gtnh.quest3137.name=Bet On The Distillus
gtnh.quest3137.desc=IV brings forth GT++ multis, including an upgrade for the Distillation Tower, called the Dangote Distillus. In structure, it's exactly the same as the DT, but it uses a different controller that has a more complicated recipe. It needs more expensive items, and it's also locked to an IV Chemical Plant, which makes it a very expensive craft if it is the only use you have for that plant. %n%nThat said, it solves the issue of DTs being slow, and those are essentially the backbone of all of these renewable setups. How many quad DTs are you going to need for reliable IV/LuV power, I might ask? Just go for it.

# Quest.3138 - More Steam For Fuel
gtnh.quest3138.name=More Steam For Fuel
gtnh.quest3138.desc=The last of the Large Boilers is IV-tier, and it's the Tungstensteel version. In numbers, it beats all of the other boilers, both in EU/t and fuel efficiency, so it's a good idea to build one or more of these if you've been working on the Super Fuels. Each one will output Superheated Steam matching an EU output of 16000 EU/t, at 100% fuel efficiency, or 24000 EU/t with 150%. %n%nAlongside this, you should also work on automating the Magic Super Fuel, if you haven't already. It needs more inputs, but it's even more bang for your buck, the entire point of this fuel line! You will need automated Blazes and Endermen, preferably, unless you can automate the Thaumcraft version of the Magic Fuel Binder recipe. For the fuel itself, Alumentum can be done simply with Charcoal Dust in a Cauldron or Thaumatorium.%n%nThe dark blue towers might ask for a lot of Large Turbines to process all of the Steam, especially if you build a quad boiler setup. You can expect almost 11000 L/t of it as output, per boiler, so look at some of the turbines you can craft and check out how many you need. The quest after this one gives some suggestions for battling the potential turbine spam.

# Quest.3139 - Huge Turbines And Loose Mode
gtnh.quest3139.name=Huge Turbines And Loose Mode
gtnh.quest3139.desc=If you are invested in making good IV power from Super Fuel, you will need a lot of Turbine multis. Their EU/t at optimal flow is much too low for you to survive with only one or two. However, there are several things you should consider in regards to these turbines, and the fuel you're using.%n%nIn summary, this fuel is very, very efficient. Turbines can be made faster by losing some efficiency. You have more than enough fuel efficiency to spare!%n%nLet's review this in more detail. Turbines produce EU based on the flow rate of the fuel that they are consuming. Their optimal flow represents the highest fuel efficiency they can reach (140% or 150% for the good turbines in these tiers), but you can increase the flow beyond that point and still get a higher EU/t value. However, the fuel becomes less efficient. A good tradeoff, if you need it.%n%nSteam loses efficiency quickly if you do this, though. The right way to pull this off with Steam Turbines is to switch to Loose mode, a mode unique to them, which makes the optimal flow shoot way up at a considerable loss to fuel efficiency. The jump in EU/t is so high, however, that you can replace a whole squadron of turbines with just one or two, as you can see if you look at the turbine items' tooltips.%n%nEach setup has their own details, so you will have to work things out and make personal decisions about how you will manage the turbines. Just make sure to not let the EU/t value go beyond the maximum that the dynamo hatch can output, or you will have problems!

# Quest.3140 - Processing Array Automation
gtnh.quest3140.name=Processing Array Automation
gtnh.quest3140.desc=This one is technically an EV multi, but it's hard to find the amount of Tungstensteel you need for it at that tier. The Processing Array's only purpose is to receive singleblock machines that process materials, like a Macerator, Compressor, and many others. It can use up to 64 of one of those, and does their processing as if they were all running, allowing the inputs and outputs to be moved to one spot, and making a setup more compact and less laggy.%n%nFluid extracting Charcoal into Wood Tar is an example of a step that might want a Processing Array. Even though the recipe time isn't very high (much lower than it used to be), you can make it very fast with just one multi, even when using LV and MV machines to avoid wasteful overclocks. This applies to almost all kinds of processing, with the GT++ multis competing for the same role. Each of those is built differently, and has different requirements, so it's a good idea to check them all to see whether or not a PA is more worthwhile than they are.

# Quest.3141 - Distilling Benzene
gtnh.quest3141.name=Distilling Benzene
gtnh.quest3141.desc=From Wood Tar, you can selectively filter out the energetic Benzene to use as a power source. This tar is like a fluid equivalent of the Charcoal, and it actually has a lot of useful chemicals hidden inside: to separate them, the tar needs to be heated up to a temperature that will cause some of its components to evaporate, but not others. This is fractional distillation, and the singleblock Distillery, in this case an MV one, can recover only one of the outputs of such distillation.%n%nThere is something that is worth considering, though: Benzene is not the only useful chemical that can be gotten from Wood Tar. In HV, you can get all the outputs at the same time, but right now you can only choose one. Other options that you might want are Toluene and Creosote. The former can be used to make TNT, to do Implosion Compressor crafts, and the latter is useful to make Lubricant, if you ran out of it and are not using Coke Ovens anymore. 

# Quest.3142 - §6§lFaster Crops
gtnh.quest3142.name=§6§lFaster Crops
gtnh.quest3142.desc=§WWelcome to my ted talk, today we talk about the §6§lExtreme Industrial Greenhouse.%n§rIt is the most advanced and §l§nLAG FREE§r crop farm that will allow you to supply the amount of tea you need.%nThe machine starts at §5EV§r, but to farm IC2 crops you will need at least §dLuV§r power.%nTo see the structure, place the controller on ground and use a structure hologram to build.%nThe glass tier limits the energy tier until §3UV§r. With §3UV§r glass you can have an energy tier as high as you want.%nShift click with screwdriver to change crop type (IC2/normal), sadly you can't farm both in one machine.%nThere are 3 modes to manage your crops (change with screwdriver):%n%n§lSetup mode (input):%n§rIn this mode you can plant your crops in the machine.%nJust put them in the input bus and enable the machine with a soft mallet.%nAdditionally, you need to insert block that is required for IC2 crop to grow (if any)%nWhen the bus is empty, just disable it and change the mode.%nKeep in mind that there is limited space of slots for your crops depending on the voltage.%nWith normal crops you start with 1 slot and that multiplies by 2 every tier past §5EV§r, every slot can take 64 crops of the same type.%nWith IC2 crops you start with 4 slots and that multiplies by 4 every tier past §dLuV§r, every slot can take only 1 crop.%n%n§lSetup mode (output):%n§rThis mode allows you to move your Greenhouse or upgrade your crops.%nWhen the machine is running in this mode it will output all planted crops in the output bus.%n%n§lNormal operation:%n§rWith normal crops it is a straightforward process.

Additionally the time is lower every tier past §5EV§r §o(The time is divided by the number of tiers past §6HV§r§o, minimum 1 second. WOW) §r%n%nIC2 crops on the other hand, are not that easy. They are normally simulated, but accelerated 32 times. Process time is 5 seconds. You can check the progress of the growing process with a tricorder.%n%nIf you want to grow your crops even faster, then you can use a fertilizer (up to §l400% more drops§r !). Machine will take fertilizer from the input busses on start of the operation and will be applied to that operation only. Each fetilizer gives +200% per crop in normal mode or +10% in IC2 mode. The bonus is applied evenly on crops.

# Quest.3143 - Quantum Chestplate
gtnh.quest3143.name=Quantum Chestplate
gtnh.quest3143.desc=You can make a Quantum Chestplate as well. You can fly with it, but the hover mode is not great and it is a lot slower than the Advanced NanoChestPlate because it doesn't have a boost mode. What you really want is the GraviChestPlate but that is ZPM-tier. Alternatively you can make a magic infused chestplate.

# Quest.3144 - Too much Indium?
gtnh.quest3144.name=Too much Indium?
gtnh.quest3144.desc=Milling process is an alternative way to produce Indium, designed for ZPM and UV people. It does not void Aluminium and Galena for no reason, and you can extract Indium from Sphalerite efficiently. In exchange of machine cost and infrastructure needed to process.%n%n§3This multi is LuV, but you have to use in combination with Vacuum Furnace, which is ZPM.

# Quest.3145 - Basis for All Reactors
gtnh.quest3145.name=Basis for All Reactors
gtnh.quest3145.desc=Nuclear energy is first available in EV. However, it comes in all shapes and forms, and it can be hard to choose one kind of setup to use amongst all of those that are available. To start this questbook page, this first quest will be a summary of how nuclear power can be produced, and when it is available. Other quests down the line will have more details about each specific setup, but this is an overview of all of them.%n%nTL;DR: Nuke < Fluid Nuke < Vacuum Nuke < LFTR = THTR = Naq Reactor < Fusion < Compact Fusion for power, per reactor. For breeding, Nuke < LFTR = Naq Reactor < HTGR in terms of breeding speed and outputs, with fusion being required to make some materials.%n%nThe first nuclear source you have access to is the Industrialcraft 2 Nuclear Reactor, usually called a nuke. It's a small singleblock that can have additional chambers attached to it to make a multiblock structure, and the amount of chambers decides the amount of space available for the nuke's components. Inside it, fuel rods with radioactive materials generate power, and every other item serves to control the temperature of the reactor and keep it from exploding. It generates EU directly, but it can be upgraded to a fluid nuke, which outputs hot coolant instead, for the Large Heat Exchanger, but with more efficiency. Lastly, there's also the vacuum nuke, which is very similar to regular nukes but it cools down by using Coolant Cells, which wear out and are only reusable by using Vacuum Freezers. Usual fuels for all of these are Thorium, in EV, and Uranium, in IV.%n%nBetween IV and LuV, there's another kind of reactor, the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR). In this large multi, the Thorium and Uranium are mixed with very hot, molten salts (which need to be prepared in another multi), improving the power generation at the cost of additional processing. It's an expensive setup, but the depleted fuel can be recycled into many more byproducts than usual, especially at LuV, where you can get almost all the noble gases amongst other things, alongside huge amounts of power.%n%nAt those same tiers (albeit mostly for LuV and above), there are also two larger multis, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor (THTR) and the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR). The THTR is mostly for power, needing an input of about 0.5 IV amps and outputting LuV power at a varied amount of amps, whereas the HTGR is a breeder reactor, outputting 1/20 the amount of hot coolant, which is where the power generation comes from, but with much better ratios for breeding into Lutetium and other elements.%n%nAnother kind of nuclear reactor is the Good Generators Naquadah Reactor, which coincidentally has recipes to consume Thorium Liquid Fuel and Uranium Liquid Fuel, alongside the several types of Naquadah fuel that exist. With these two, this reactor can process those elements much faster than regular nukes, which is helpful for power and for breeding, but it requires more processing until those fuels are ready to be consumed. Additionally, there are fuel rods for the IC2 nukes that use different Thorium and Uranium fuels, more or less related to these. %n%nFrom then on, it's fusion power. The infamous GregTech Fusion Reactors work by fusing two elements into a new one, which is often a required step for progression, but they also turn the power they require into exponentially more in the way of plasma. Helium and Tin Plasma are some of the most used for power, and putting them into Plasma Turbines is an excellent source of power for lategame, in ZPM to UEV and so on. There are 4 tiers to the regular Fusion Reactors, but there is also compact fusion and some other kinks to fusion that you might explore later on.%n%nThis page will mostly serve to guide you into making a choice between all of these possibilities. It's pretty much guaranteed that you'll use at least 2-3 of these setups, so try to get comfortable with these quest descriptions.

# Quest.3146 - Focus on Breeding
gtnh.quest3146.name=Focus on Breeding
gtnh.quest3146.desc=This side of the advanced fission branch will focus on the items you can get from nuclear fission. In terms of physics, this fission refers to atoms being broken into two parts, each of which generates a different atom. This has potential to produce some interesting stuff and, perhaps, replace some chemical lines.%n%nAs you advance, your rewards will scale just as the complexity does. However, this part is one where development has lagged behind, and some fission setups are poorly rewarding when it comes to byproducts. However, as those setups are updated, so will these quests, so check back on new updates to see what has changed!

# Quest.3147 - Fission Guidelines
gtnh.quest3147.name=Fission Guidelines
gtnh.quest3147.desc=The branch to the left and to the right are both about nuclear fission, or the midgame content about fusion. If you're looking for fusion, you went the wrong way! Go straight down for that content, although it only begins in LuV.%n%nOn the left side, the top side is the beginning of it all, with your usual IC2 nukes that were developed more than 10 years ago. On the bottom, the neat and powerful upgrades to those nukes, either fluid or vacuum.%n%nOn the right side, the top side is dedicated to power, whereas the bottom side is dedicated to breeding (byproducts). This covers the more GTNH-exclusive fission content, all of which comes after IC2 nukes, and generally builds on their concept to work faster and pump out more complex, and often more useful things.

# Quest.3148 - IC2 Nuke Variations
gtnh.quest3148.name=IC2 Nuke Variations
gtnh.quest3148.desc=This branch of the questline focuses on the IC2 nukes that work differently from the simple kind that is explored on the branch right next to this one. They are more powerful, but also require more setup.%n%nThe main two kinds are fluid nukes and vacuum nukes, which will be explained in the following quests. However, there are also other obscure types, such as wrench nukes, which might or might not work in the current version. Additionally, someone suggested you could disassemble a nuke to reset the heat amount?%n%nThose are memes, but if any new viable type of IC2 nuke is ever introduced, it will be explained in this section.

# Quest.3149 - Build the Assembly Line First
gtnh.quest3149.name=Build the Assembly Line First
gtnh.quest3149.desc=This branch refers to nuclear fusion. This content is strictly LuV onwards, so you will need the Assembly Line before even starting to think about fusion. It is the most "endgame" content on this quest page, so it's the one left for last.%n%nThe quest you need to complete is in the "Multiblock Goals" tab. There are also fusion-related quests in the LuV, ZPM and UV tabs, amongst others, so check them out when you're there.

# Quest.3150 - Improved Fission
gtnh.quest3150.name=Improved Fission
gtnh.quest3150.desc=This branch starts at mid-IV. In this direction, you will find several setups that are related to nuclear fission, the same process that the IC2 nukes do, but in more complex and rewarding ways. Through here, you can get power and breeding byproducts as you would with nukes, but faster and with more variety of options and goals. %n%nThat's right. If you've used IC2 nukes, you might have learned more or less how they work, but the whole system feels a bit dated. That's no surprise, considering that this is base IC2 content and from 10 years ago or more. Whatever additions GTNH gave to those setups, they were minimal in comparison to the general implementation of those nukes. In fact, some of the new content for those was a result of new nuclear fission content that was sort of backported into nukes. %n%nWe have good progression standards here, though. Once you've reached IV, LuV and so on, you will be able to use more advanced ways to work with Thorium and Uranium! These fuels are almost always the focus of the whole thing, with Plutonium coming in from time to time, but each new reactor will demand them to be supplied in a different way for things to work properly. The reactors featured here are the LFTR, the THTR/HTGR and the Naq-related reactors.%n%nFinally, this questline features many different multis and setups that are often unrelated to each other. Instead of forcing you to build a full LFTR setup before getting access to the THTR, for example, these quests will have simple required tasks, and simple rewards. The optional tasks will have the main expensive crafting, to guide you in building these setups if you're interested in them.

# Quest.3151 - Thorium as Early Power
gtnh.quest3151.name=Thorium as Early Power
gtnh.quest3151.desc=The very first step into nuclear power is done with Thorium in an Industrialcraft2 nuke. This multiblock already has a good amount of information in the questbook, split between the EV and How to Generate Power pages, so you should look at those if you want even more information that might not be written here. For the sake of not repeating everything, this will be more of a summary.%n%nThorium nukes are better for creating other elements, specifically Lutetium, than for power. The best setup needs the maximum amount of chambers, 6, and a lot of components inside the reactor to burn 10 quad Thorium rods and generate 1920 EU/t, close to one EV amp. If you made 4 of these, you would get close to an IV amp, but this becomes very costly between the total 36 chambers and the recursive crafting of the components inside. The good news is that Thorium is a very cheap fuel, easily mined in the Nether, and recyclable in large amounts from depleted fuel rods.%n%nThis setup, and many others, can be found in the GTNH wiki in the "Nuclear Reactors" page. However, to display it here as best I can, this is the 1920 EU/t Thorium reactor:%n%nOPVOVOPPO%nEOOEOEOOE%nORRORORRO%nORRORORRO%nEOOEOEOOE%nOPPOVOVPO%n%nE -> Component Heat Exchanger (8 needed)%nV -> Component Heat Vent (4 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (26 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Thorium (10 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (6 needed)%n%nYou can make this setup, if you wish, but the only required task to continue to the next quest are 10 single Thorium rods. 

# Quest.3152 - The Path of Fusion
gtnh.quest3152.name=The Path of Fusion
gtnh.quest3152.desc=The most advanced nuclear technology there is to use in the pack is nuclear fusion. This is an event where two atoms collide with each other and fuse into a different atom while simultaneously generating energy from the plasma, when it is processed. It's impossible to perform in a reactor in real life, because the temperature requirements are too high to maintain any kind of reactor solid with decent efficiency. In GTNH, though, we have better materials.%n%nThe first Fusion Reactor can be built in late LuV, and each tier unlocks some material that is important to progress into the later tiers. Fusion crafting becomes important at that stage, for materials such as Europium, Americium, Neutronium and Oganesson, so you will want to dedicate reactors to specific things later on. More importantly, these materials come out as plasma, which needs to be cooled down to be turned into ingots and plates. On top of that, though, this cooling process is where you can get lots of power!%n%nThe usual process of power generation here is to pump EU into the Fusion Reactor. It needs enough energy to start the reaction, which will then proceed quickly and output good amounts of plasma. This plasma goes into Plasma Turbines, which output huge amounts of EU/t and the cooled down material, ready to be used in further crafting. A beginner's setup can output 640,000 EU/t from one reactor before overclocking, and this grows quickly over time. Fusion power dominates the game for several tiers due to its simplicity, receding away from the powergen setups that were getting more and more complicated with each tier. Two materials fuse into one, plasma comes out, goes into turbine and boom, lots of energy! It's like a steam tier powergen but with big numbers.%n%nTo summarize, fusion is required for progression because of the materials it produces. At the same time, it's very powerful as a source of EU.

# Quest.3153 - Building the Reactor
gtnh.quest3153.name=Building the Reactor
gtnh.quest3153.desc=All the regular Fusion Reactors share the same structure. The tier they belong to is determined by the materials used, which become more expensive for each tier. Tier 1 is LuV, tier 2 is ZPM, tier 3 is UV and there's also a tier 4. The structure looks like a huge ring, which barely fits in one chunk, with the controller on the inside of the ring, not the outside.%n%nTo help you with placing all the blocks in the right places, the controller's interface shows a diagram of which blocks go where. To get a 3D view of the placements in the world, use the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector on the controller. If you need even more assistance, there are lots of resources on the internet that explain how it's build, since this is a big GregTech multiblock that is required in many packs, and almost always built the same way.%n%nThe original quests for each reactor tier will be included in the questline, since they provide good information about each tier and are updated.

# Quest.3154 - Fluid Nukes
gtnh.quest3154.name=Fluid Nukes
gtnh.quest3154.desc=Eventually, the previous nukes will not be big enough. You can make more of them, to get more power, but it's clear that you need something bigger. Bigger, literally. The next step in nuclear fission starts with a bigger multiblock, built on top of the original nuke. By surrounding it with a 5x5x5 cube of Reactor Pressure Vessels, it will become a different type of multiblock, the fluid nuke.%n%nAfter doing this, there's no direct EU generation anymore. The main output of a working fluid nuke is Hot Coolant, a fluid that can be turned into Steam or Superheated Steam in another multi, the Large Heat Exchanger (LHE). Steam means power, as you already know, so the obvious chain of processes here is a fluid nuke into an LHE, and then into Steam Turbines. These added steps are required to make EU from a nuke of this type (or, at least, they're the most popular way of doing it), but this work is rewarded by the final EU/t output of the setup, which is much larger than a regular nuke's output with the same amount of fuel.%n%nThe difference exists because regular nukes actually have a 50% penalty to EU/t. It's such a big step-up that, in reality, one fluid nuke is enough for IV power, if it's powerful enough. The one in this quest, though, is not that one, because fluid nukes in general have some additional complications that will be harder to deal with it. In fact, for this, you have the option to use Thorium as fuel and still get a good amount of power! What you will need are the fluid nuke blocks, but there is an optional task for this setup that only needs some blocks from the setup.

# Quest.3155 - Thorium as Breeding Fuel
gtnh.quest3155.name=Thorium as Breeding Fuel
gtnh.quest3155.desc=Alternatively, you might choose to only process Thorium for its main output, Lutetium. This is important because Lutetium is required to make Americium in a Fusion Reactor down the line, and that is a recipe you will need to do in order to progress. Your objective is to breed Thorium into Lutetium, which means you might want to focus on a breeder reactor.%n%nWhat is a breeder reactor? In this case, it's an IC2 nuke designed to consume as much Thorium as possible. The main cost here is the amount of chambers or nuke components you'll have to make. If you want to save on Overclocked Heat Vents, make a tower of 0-chamber nukes, each with the following setup:%n%nRPR%nORP%nRPR%nPRP%nRPR%nORP%n%nR -> Single Fuel Rod of Thorium (9 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (2 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (7 needed)%n%nOtherwise, if you have excess Overclocked Heat Vents and want to save up on chambers, turn to this setup:%n%nORORORO%nROEOEOR%nORORORO%nROROROR%nOPOPOPO%nROROROR%n%nE -> Heat Exchanger (2 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Thorium (16 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (21 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (3 needed)%n%n(Each of the latter is worth 7x the former in terms of breeding.)%n%nTo complete this quest, you'll need to get Lutetium from one cycle of the any reactor setup. Which setup you choose is up to you, of course.

# Quest.3156 - Large Heat Infrastructure
gtnh.quest3156.name=Large Heat Infrastructure
gtnh.quest3156.desc=A required intermediate machine between your fluid nukes and your power is the Large Heat Exchanger (LHE). It takes in a hot fluid, in this case Hot Coolant, and transforms Distilled Water into Steam or Superheated Steam depending on how fast the hot fluid is coming in. It's important to only use Distilled Water here, because the Steam Turbines will output and recycle it back to the LHE.%n%nFor this purpose, you will need around one LHE per fluid nuke if you're doing one of the good setups from the wiki. None of them will reach the maximum flow one LHE can accept, but any setup above 800 HU will give you Superheated Steam, which is more efficient for EU and what you want to get.%n%nIf your setup does not match that 800 HU threshold, you can use a Hot Coolant buffer and set up a redstone latch so that the Hot Coolant flows in fast enough, until the buffer is almost empty. ProjectRed has a special block that acts as the latch, and you will then need two redstone signals that scale with the amount of fluid stored in your buffer tank. One of the signals should be normal, and the other reversed.%n%n

# Quest.3157 - Fuel Input Automation
gtnh.quest3157.name=Fuel Input Automation
gtnh.quest3157.desc=Reactor Platings. These are very important for automation, although their supposed use is not this one. They serve to increase the maximum temperature of the reactor, but that is useless to you because you'll be using heat-neutral setups. Instead, they are simply the cheapest way to fill every slot of your nukes, except for those where fuel rods need to go.%n%nAs you know, the placement of each component is critical to keep the reactor safe. Fuel automation is as simple as just pushing fuel rods into the reactor, but you need to make it so the open slots are the only safe places for the rods. From there, you can extract with a filter set to the depleted version of the rods you are using. and the exchange will happen seamlessly.%n%nFrom there, you can turn the depleted rods into usable rods by putting them in the Thermal Centrifuge, adding back the fuel that wasn't recycled (each type of rod recycles different amounts of fuel) and the Empty Fuel Rods/Steel Rods.

# Quest.3158 - Focus On Power Generation
gtnh.quest3158.name=Focus On Power Generation
gtnh.quest3158.desc=Each side of this branch will focus on one of the two halves of nuclear fission outputs. This side will focus on generating power from the reactors available here, which is probably why you're here in the first place.%n%nThese setups share one purpose: when they were created, they were meant to bridge the gap between IC2 nukes and fusion, because there was really nothing else worth using beyond fluid nukes if there were no backups available, or redstone automation was too unreliable for vacuum nukes. Not only is there a full 2-tier gap of one single powergen until fusion, but there's also a required power input in order to begin a fusion reaction in the first place. This is both boring and difficult to push through, especially with the Assembly Line in the middle, so here we are.%n%nThe first setup you can put together is the LFTR chain, although only one half of it is available in IV. As such, that is where we will start.

# Quest.3159 - Liquid Fluorine Thorium Reactor
gtnh.quest3159.name=Liquid Fluorine Thorium Reactor
gtnh.quest3159.desc=What a complicated name this is. What does it mean?%n%nWell, it's what is called a molten salt reactor. The Liquid Fluoride part means that the nuclear fuel is actually a liquid, mixed in with fluoride salts. This is a mechanism that makes it more difficult to get the fuel ready for fission, but also makes the process more efficient, gives out more byproducts and also removes the danger of explosion. That's right, nuclear meltdowns are a thing of the past! The molten salt is designed to flow downwards into a hole where it solidifies, in case the reactor has problems, so it's impossible for the fission process to continue into an explosive mess.%n%nThere are three downsides, though. One of them was mentioned just above, the fuel needs more processing to be ready for the LFTR, and more input materials to reach the right mixture. After it goes through the reactor, it comes out as depleted, and this part too requires more processing steps, although it gives out a lot more useful chemicals than the single Lutetium/Plutonium the IC2 nuke depletion process gave. Lastly, the molten salt is very hot and very corrosive, which means it would destroy the materials used to build the IC2 nukes. You will need newer, stronger and more expensive materials to build a reactor, not to mention its much larger size. %n%nThe structure for this multi is truly something else. It has not one, but four required Dynamo Hatches, which should all be the Buffered type, either EV, IV or LuV depending on the fuel being fed into the reactor, with better fuels being unlocked at later progression stages. This means that one LFTR makes either 1 LuV amp, 1 ZPM amp or 1 UV amp while running. It also requires 2 Maintenance and 4 Muffler Hatches, when it has no maintenance problems or pollution output! Mysterious are the workings of this reactor.%n%nOther than this, all the inputs and outputs are fluids. The minimum amount you'll need is 2 inputs and 4 outputs, although one of the outputs comes out over time, and not on recipe finish. This output is Uranium 233, a very rare isotope that can get you deeper into LFTR fuels and more power, hardly obtainable from any other source.

# Quest.3160 - First Half of LFTR Breeding
gtnh.quest3160.name=First Half of LFTR Breeding
gtnh.quest3160.desc=The LFTR processing chain has two halves, with the first being in mid-late IV and the second requiring the Assembly Line and more materials to finish. Aside from power, both of these halves have special outputs that can be helpful for progression, but the second half is most likely the one that holds the most value. Regardless, the full processing chain around the reactor and its fuel will keep outputting everything, so it's worth it to look at what it gives.%n%nLet's start with the LFTR Fuel 1 outputs, after the fuel is consumed in the reactor. U233 and UF6 are both used to make more fuel. U233 will be used until you have Sparge Towers to improve your fuel production, while UF6 is a part of the good fuel recipe that you always want to use. T Salt is processed in the Reactor Processing Unit to yield Proactinium, which decays into even more U233, and then in the Cold Trap to yield more U233 and UF6.%n%nRemember: U233 is the early source of fuel, UF6 is the one you will switch to as you progress.%n%nMeanwhile, U Salt also processes into more fuel, but with a bonus of automated Phosphorous Dust. Unfortunately, you won't get a lot of it, but it is still a breeding output from the nuclear fission and is needed for GT++ alloys and other purposes.%n%nTB Salt is very similar to T Salt, but with higher amounts of the same output and also Beryllium Fluoride, whose output grows into more than what you used when you reach the later parts of the chain. Free Beryllium!

# Quest.3161 - Sparge Tower
gtnh.quest3161.name=Sparge Tower
gtnh.quest3161.desc=This is the last structure of the LFTR chain, and the only one gated after the Assembly Line. The best LFTR fuel, Fuel 3, is locked after this, and a lot of useful byproducts are only obtainable here as well, so it's important that you build this if you have a working LFTR.%n%nThe structure itself is very similar to a Distillation Tower, but with different blocks. The controller is the most expensive part, but the biggest obstacle is having the Assembly Line; everything after that shouldn't be too difficult. It's recommended that you have more than one tower, but for one focus on making only one. %n%nNote: the height of this tower is not adjustable. It is meant to be a 3x8x3 multiblock with at least 45 Sparge Tower Casings.

# Quest.3162 - Fusion Europium
gtnh.quest3162.name=Fusion Europium
gtnh.quest3162.desc=There are chemical elements that are very important as building materials for high-tier machines. Unfortunately, some of these elements are very hard to find naturally, if at all, and need to be created by hand. They're not alloys, not a mix of materials, but they can be a mix of atoms...%n%nEuropium is the first wall that can be solved by fusion, and usually only by fusion. It is possible to find it in ores, but it's much simpler to build a Fusion Reactor and produce it yourself, because you will need it in large quantities for your progression. It is a slow craft, but not an expensive one provided you already have the reactor built, since it uses cheap materials as inputs: Hydrogen and Neodymium. Both of these were used extensively for progression, so you should not have any trouble grabbing several hundreds of each to start this reaction.%n%nIt is important that you gather a lot of inputs. Each time the Fusion Reactor changes recipe, it has a start-up period where it needs a large amount of energy to begin crafting. In the case of Europium, you'll need 150 million EU to start crafting it, and then 7,077,888 EU per ingot of Europium crafted. This does not come out as plasma, so you can't get energy back from it! Additionally, each ingot takes 14.4 seconds to craft, so you can come out with a few stacks of Europium relatively quickly. During this time, you cannot produce plasma for power, so it's a good idea to have a good amount of EU stored, or other powergen setups working in the background, while you craft this material.%n%nWith Europium, you can craft a new kind of boule, wafers and many other things! Check NEI to see what you have unlocked.

# Quest.3163 - How Much Power From One Reactor?
gtnh.quest3163.name=How Much Power From One Reactor?
gtnh.quest3163.desc=A completed Fusion Reactor does not generate any EU on its own, it only consumes it. That said, it's very simple to generate power from plasma, a one-step process of having a Plasma Turbine. These special turbines only work with plasma and are significantly more expensive than the previous ones, requiring Tungstensteel for the body and Naquadah + Naquadah Alloy for the controller.%n%nFirst, how much plasma can one tier 1 reactor produce? The best option for power at this stage is Helium Plasma, with its cheap inputs, and this takes 6.4 seconds per bucket to generate. Since a bucket is worth 81,920,000 EU, that equates to 640,000 EU/t at 100% efficiency or 960,000 EU/t at 150%. That is almost 8 ZPM amps, a massive power spike compared to the powergen available before this, with almost no processing before the plasma! For most players, fusion is the only source of power for 3 or 4 tiers, and all other ways of getting power are much more complicated and harder to upscale.%n%nThat said, you will still need multiple turbines to actually consume all of the plasma. At LuV, each turbine can only output the equivalent of 1 ZPM amp, so you will need high-efficiency turbines that don't go above the value of 131,072 EU/t output. Three candidates, in descending order of efficiency, are: Large Rhodium-Palladium at 150% and 124,740 EU/t, Normal Draconium at 145% and 121,800 EU/t and Large Tungstencarbide at 140% and 123,480 EU/t.

# Quest.3164 - Optional Tier 1 Fusion
gtnh.quest3164.name=Optional Tier 1 Fusion
gtnh.quest3164.desc=Osmium - from Helium and Tungsten. Osmium from the platline is quite power-hungry, which this recipe won't solve, but it will at least help you past the terrible output rate of Osmium. You can get it faster from here as long as you can keep supplying Tungsten and power.%n%nSunnarium - from Helium + Glowstone. If you've had difficulty in getting lots of Sunnarium after the Molecular Transformer nerf, you can try this for your Solar Panels and other things. Glowing Coral processing with UUM is recommended, though.%n%nBoron - from Lithium and Helium. If you haven't automated this yet, for Borosilicate Glass for example, this is one way to do it. You will need lots of glass for the Mega Blast Furnace and other big multis of the kind, so it's not a useless recipe.

# Quest.3165 - UV Power Per Turbine
gtnh.quest3165.name=UV Power Per Turbine
gtnh.quest3165.desc=Once you progress enough in ZPM to make ZPM Dynamo Hatches, you can increase each turbine's output to 524,288 EU/t. At this number, you'll be a lot less limited by the turbine material, and it's possible to increase the total power output of one Fusion Reactor considerably. You can cover the total Helium Plasma output from one reactor with 3 Plasma Turbines, if you choose the right materials:%n%nLarge High Durability Compound Steel 230% 202,860 EU/t%nLarge Atomic Separation Catalyst 200% 399,672 EU/t%nLarge Adamantium 180% 170,010 EU/t%nLarge Draconium 170% 214,200 EU/t (durable)%nLarge Ichorium 170% 342,720 EU/t (very durable)%nLarge Neutronium 160% 241,920 EU/t (very durable)%n%nThe power output and final efficiency can vary a lot, based on which turbines you're using. Some of them, like Ichorium and Neutronium, last basically forever, while others will need to be replaced from time to time but offer higher efficiency. If you want to get more power per turbine, to reach closer to the dynamo's limit, you can increase the flow of plasma to the turbine, but be careful! You can't go beyond the dynamo's limit, and you will also lose efficiency as you increase the flow amount. More concrete values for efficiency loss can be found in the Plasma Turbine quest in the LuV page.%n%nMake a normal or buffered ZPM dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest.3166 - Powering-up Fluid Nukes
gtnh.quest3166.name=Powering-up Fluid Nukes
gtnh.quest3166.desc=The previous setup's EU/t might not have impressed you. You have enough materials to put together the fluid nuke structure, but you want something more than what you've seen before. What kind of setup is powerful enough to output several IV amps, and sustain a developed IV base on its own? That sort of setup is shown in this quest, but it requires more multiblocks, and therefore more expense than the previous quest's chain. The fuel is the same, Uranium, so at this point it's certainly the least of your worries, until you try to automate the fuel input, at least.%n%nThe components inside the nuke get more and more complicated, so at this point I'm going to ask you to look at the wiki, under the Nuclear Reactors page (https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Nuclear_Reactors), and scroll down to the fluid nuke setups, specifically the 1352 HU, 2 Quad Uranium and 1408, 3 Quad Uranium, 1 Dual Uranium ones. The main difference between these two setups is that the first needs Iridium Neutron Reflectors, which are quite expensive if you haven't done the platline yet, while the second doesn't use them but is harder to automate due to having more than one type of rod.%n%nWhat's the final EU/t output, at 150% turbine efficiency? 30240 and 31680 EU/t, respectively.%n%nAfter automating the nuke itself, there is still more to do, though. The LHE is required, as usual, but these setups cause something new to happen: the LHE starts outputting Superheated Steam, due to the high flow of hot coolant that it receives, which means that you need two sets of turbines instead of one. This type of steam must go into Large HP Steam Turbines, which use a good amount of Tungstensteel for the controller and stacks of Titanium for the casings. After those, it goes into the usual Large Steam Turbines, and the process is complete.%n%nThere is yet another new thing to worry about, in case all of this wasn't enough: the Steam flow is very high, higher than before, which means it's likely you will need 3 or more of each turbine type, further compounding on the costs you'll have here. Oriharukon and MAR-Ce-M200 are your best choices. Are you willing to tackle this setup?

# Quest.3167 - Vacuum Nukes
gtnh.quest3167.name=Vacuum Nukes
gtnh.quest3167.desc=What's the next step, running nuclear reactors in a perfect vacuum? That would be pretty funny, I'd like to see that.%n%nDisclaimer: this last step is not very stable. It's very risky to do it in servers with no backups, because it relies on redstone circuits to keep the reactor from exploding. Use multiple failsafes to guarantee safety. Never ever build a vacuum nuke in a Thermos server!%n%nVacuum nukes are an interesting GTNH-specific setup. They use only three components: fuel rods, platings to fill the empty slots for automation purposes, and coolant cells. Those cells you have used to make Energy Hatches, for example, they're used here to keep the reactor from overheating and exploding. The main difference this setup has is that these cells are consumable, and will wear out over time. You will need to add fresh cells into the reactor to keep running it safely, but the crux of the show is that you don't need to make new ones - you just need to cool them down again.%n%nThe Vacuum Freezer! That's why it's called a vacuum nuke! Elementary, my dear Steve. This kind of setup relies on using EU to refill the coolant cells, so to speak, and get much more EU from the reactor than you spend to keep it running. However, the redstone automation for this is quite tricky. If you just try it blindly, it might take you a long time to figure it out, and it might have explosive results. Check the Vacuum Reactors page on the wiki (https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Vacuum_Reactors) if you want a detailed guide that goes far beyond what I could write in this quest description.%n%nThis quest task is for the last setup shown in the wiki, specifically the 8720-43600 EU, 40 Quad Uranium setup. As the title implies, it can produce up to 43600 EU/t, but it will require multiple filters and failsafes to run it safely. The bonus, compared to fluid nukes, is that the LHE + turbine setup is not necessary for these high output numbers.

# Quest.3168 - Can We Get Uranium Here?
gtnh.quest3168.name=Can We Get Uranium Here?
gtnh.quest3168.desc=Yes, you can. In fact, you can get it much earlier than EV, but the speed at which you get it can vary wildly, depending on how you approach this problem. Uranium is the main upgrade to Thorium in nukes, with a lot more power to give and a different useful breeding byproduct, but you need about 3 stacks of Uranium 238 to set up the most powerful basic IC2 Uranium Nuke.%n%nHow do you get it, though? The one answer is, you get it from Thorium. Looking at NEI, the Thorium ore processing has a chance to give Uranium dusts, which you can use as fuel, but this happens very slowly, especially considering that Thorium is a rare ore in the Nether, even if each ore block gives 4 crushed dust. The reality seems to be that fast Uranium only happens when you can mine from t2 planets, but this is not the only way. There is a secret, and this secret involves IC2 crops.%n%nHow does it work? Well, it's simple. The IC2 crop that corresponds to Thorium, the God of Thunder, can quadruple each Crushed Thorium Ore into 4 Purified Thorium Ore, but it also outputs, in fluid form, one Uranium Ingot! This means that each Thorium Ore gives you 4 Uranium Ingots, and with around 42 ore, you can do one cycle of that big reactor setup. God of Thunder needs the ore under it, though, so make sure you save some for that purpose.%n%nEV Uranium nukes are a achievement intended mostly for IC2 crop users, so this quest won't demand something like that. Still, it's a useful secret, so here it is. Additionally, the Uranium crop quest in the questbook awards you with 32 Pitchblende when you complete it, which might prove useful for both for quadrupling Uranium and getting Radium for Radon!

# Quest.3169 - Uranium Basic Nukes
gtnh.quest3169.name=Uranium Basic Nukes
gtnh.quest3169.desc=The big brother to the Thorium nuke, the Uranium nuke. The biggest setup you can put together for a single IC2 Nuclear Reactor uses 7 Quad Uranium Rods, or 28 single rods. This amounts to almost 3 stacks of Uranium 238 (U238), a difficult amount to get from Thorium but much easier to get from the green ores found in Phobos. The setup is very similar to the previous one, but with some important differences. What are they?%n%nThe first one is the fuel. These fuel rods use a mixture of U238 and a bit of U235, which is rarer. To get U235, you can gamble on the chance of getting the dust from processing some of the related ores, which might be good enough, but it's also possible to use Thaumcraft to convert 9 nuggets of U238 to 7 nuggets of U235, without needing a lot of Thaumcraft progress. Assembling this fuel and putting it into rods gets it ready to be used for power, with more EU/t but less burn time compared to Thorium, 50000 seconds for Thorium compared to 20000 seconds for Uranium.%n%nThe second difference in the nuke setup. Uranium eats up more per rod, so a different arrangement inside the nuke is required. For the highest EU/t in this situation, 4200 EU/t, the setup is:%n%nRVOEOOVOP%nPVOOVOORO%nPOROOROOV%nVOOVOOVOP%nOROOROORO%nPOVPOVPOV%n%nE -> Component Heat Exchanger (1 needed)%nV -> Component Heat Vent (11 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (28 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Uranium (7 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (7 needed)%n%nWhen the fuel rods get repleted, you can reprocess them to get 3/4 of the U235 back, and also a bit of Plutonium.

# Quest.3170 - Further IC2 Nuke Potential
gtnh.quest3170.name=Further IC2 Nuke Potential
gtnh.quest3170.desc=An observant nuclear scientist might have seen many more options for IC2 nukes than those mentioned in the quests up to this point. Thorium, Uranium, Thorium, Uranium... what about all of these other things, what do they do?%n%nUnfortunately, this is where the copying of builds ends. The nuke research that has been done is almost all about the fuel rods that existed from base IC2, namely the Thorium, Uranium and MOX ones. Almost all the others were added with GTNH, and they are more or less ignored by most players. However, not all of them are useless! To see why, keep reading.%n%nGoodGenerators has added two new pairs of Uranium and Plutonium rods: High Density, and Excited. Both of these use a lot more of the element per rod, to the extent where you'll need stacks and stacks of each to run a single nuke, which means that these are fuels for later in progression, when you have stockpiled a lot of U238. The main difference is that High Density rods output a lot more EU/t with the same heat output, whereas the Excited rods do output a lot more heat than usual. This means that the former are good for vacuum nukes, while the latter are good for fluid nukes. This is true because vac nukes want more EU/t from rods with less heat, to make the coolant cells last longer, while fluid nukes produce Hot Coolant directly from the amount of heat dissipated into the reactor. The Plutonium versions also have MOX-like behavior, while the Uranium ones don't.%n%nThis is not the end of high-powered nukes, though. There is a special, one-of-a-kind fuel rod called The Core, and there is a single vac nuke setup in the wiki using these things that outputs 7.906.206 EU/t, or about 3 amps of UHV. A truly ridiculous number, matching the truly ridiculous cost of making the fuel itself. This is a setup for a time in which you shouldn't be using IC2 nukes anymore, a true challenge for the mad nuclear scientist.%n%nWhat else is there? Unfortunately, not much. Every other fuel rod is largely useless. Tiberium rods can breed Zirconium and Xenon, if you need them, Lithium breeds Tritium and the Naquadah rods are unbelievably bad at generating power, which many other better reactors to use the Naquadah in. In terms of power, nothing else is worth using.

# Quest.3171 - High Density Vacuum Nukes
gtnh.quest3171.name=High Density Vacuum Nukes
gtnh.quest3171.desc=Throw more U238 at it!%n%nIf you ever though that a vacuum nuke doesn't burn through Uranium fast enough, this one is for you. High Density Uranium, or HDU, outputs twice the EU of the regular Uranium rods, and lasts for 70000 seconds instead of 20000. The heat output, like mentioned before, is the same, so the actual effect of using these rods in a vacuum nuke setup is that your final EU/t per nuke is multiplied by 2, and rods will need to be replaced less often, but the U238 consumption per cycle is a lot higher.%n%nThis also helps if you aren't automating the fuel rod input, since each one lasts longer. It's better if it's automated, but there's no danger of explosions if this part is done manually, so it's technically safe, as long as your EU buffer doesn't start complaining from lack of input.%n%nAs the last step before using The Core, you have High Density Plutonium. This HDP has MOX-like behavior, so it can output even more EU/t than HDU, up to several LuV amps per nuke, but you need to keep it running at high temperatures, which means even more risk! There is no such thing as too much safety, if you try to put one of these together.

# Quest.3172 - Plutonium 239
gtnh.quest3172.name=Plutonium 239
gtnh.quest3172.desc=Red as an ingot, white as a blob. These are the same element, and the same isotope, even if they don't seem like it.%n%nPlutonium is a major part of nuclear fission reaction, mainly as an product of Uranium fissile fuel, when an atom in the mix captures a neutron and then emits an electron and an anti-neutrino. After several hours in the reactor, the fuel is considered depleted and there's enough Plutonium in it to separate the two through thermal centrifuging, a basic and inefficient way to do nuclear reprocessing. Later on, it's possible to improve your methods of handling spent nuclear fuel, but this is the first way you get this nuclear byproduct.%n%nIf you've made Quantum Eyes, you might know one of the main uses of Plutonium: to get Radium. By having enough of it to serve as a catalyst in the reaction, you can convert Uranium to Radium in small quantities without losing any Plutonium. Since you need 6 ingots, you will have to do 3 cycles of the setup shown in the quest before this one, or more if you're running smaller Uranium nukes. However, there is another useful thing you can use this for at this time: more nuclear fuel.%n%nNot just more nuclear fuel, but a different, more complex but also more powerful nuclear fuel. It's known as MOX fuel, and it is essentially a mix of Uranium and Plutonium. The catch is that all the Plutonium spent on creating the fuel is returned to you when reprocessing the depleted rods, alongside the extra you usually get, but not the Uranium return. To source a nuke of this kind, you will need more than 6 ingots.

# Quest.3173 - Excited Fluid Nukes
gtnh.quest3173.name=Excited Fluid Nukes
gtnh.quest3173.desc=This quest is after the vacuum nuke one because the fuel required to do a setup like this is harder to get. Whereas the previous rods were made with compressed Uranium, this fuel needs that same material to then be further processed in GoodGenerators machines, namely the Neutron Activator, to make Excited Uranium Liquid Fuel. It is directly usable in the Naquadah Reactor, with more fuel efficiency there, but you might not be able to build it yet, since it's post-fusion. Instead, you can use said fuel here.%n%nBefore attempting this, you need to know all the mechanics related to the fluid nuke. In fact, this quest won't even have any required tasks, given how challenging it is to create a good setup of this kind. At the time of writing this quest, there is no nuke simulator that supports the Excited Fuel Rods, which means you'll have to first test in Creative mode and gather whatever results you get from there.%n%nThe basis for this setup is simple: Excited Uranium Fuel Rods, the only kind you should consider for this, output 16x more heat than the regular ones, which is a lot more Hot Coolant output if you can send all this heat to the reactor to be turned into power. Only the heat matters, which means that extra EU/t based on temperature will do nothing here. Throw as many rods as you can at this nuke without overheating, that is the challenge.%n%nWhat then? You will surely need many multis if you want to process LuV amps of power, unless you choose some more advanced options. The LHE upgrades into the EHE, the Extreme Heat Exchanger, and this new multi can output either Superheated or Supercritical Steam. For the former, use XL Steam Turbines to process the ludicrous amount of Steam you will be getting. For the latter, you need special turbines.

# Quest.3174 - Nukes - Summarized
gtnh.quest3174.name=Nukes - Summarized
gtnh.quest3174.desc=IC2 nukes will fall off when you arrive at fusion energy, for the most part. Although the highest EU/t numbers obtained from these newer, more powerful cells haven't been calculated yet, it is more likely that you will be using them to process the excited materials instead of focusing your powergen on them. %n%nThat said, it is possible to push them very far by using a bigger Heat Exchanger (there are two kinds) and XL Turbines, if going fluid, or by putting together a lot of vacuum nukes. If you want to choose the latter ones, due to their direct EU/t, then there's one last step: The Core.%n%nThese are super-powerful fuel rods that can create UHV setups, as long as you cool them down with the most powerful coolant cells there are. A setup for this exists in the wiki, but the most difficult part will be the redstone automation. These babies will turn your base into a mini Sun, if you let them, so you best have practiced your redstone skills!

# Quest.3175 - MOX Nukes
gtnh.quest3175.name=MOX Nukes
gtnh.quest3175.desc=Upon gathering more Plutonium, you can try building a MOX nuke, the most powerful of the basic nukes. It is a 6-chamber, like usual, and it takes U238 as before, but it outputs close to 6820 EU/t while only using 5 quad rods instead of 7. How is this possible? The answer is... MOX.%n%nMOX means mixed-oxide, which is the name given to the mix of Uranium and Plutonium. In here, rods with this fuel are special in the sense that they don't output a specific amount of EU/t from the usual nuke mechanics. On top of those, it also reacts to the heat of the reactor, generating more energy the hotter it is. To compensate, these rods last only half the time that the Uranium fuel rods do, but their total EU is higher if they are active in very hot reactors. This imposes an obvious problem - hot reactors are not good for your base.%n%nThere is one standardized way of dealing with this: heat-neutral reactors. What this means is that the reactor's temperature does not change while it's active, because the components inside are not interacting with the reactor's temperature value, only with the value of other components like the fuel rods themselves. This limits the type of components you can use, and you'll find that Advanced Heat Vents are now required (the overclocked ones interact with the reactor itself). However, at the same time, you can use any fuel rod to heat the reactor up to a high temperature and then activate a setup of this kind, which ensures safety and efficiency in MOX nukes.%n%nVAAV%nARRA%nVAAV%nVAAV%nARRA%nVAAV%n%nA - Advanced Heat Exchanger (12 needed)%nV - Component Heat Vent (8 needed)%nR - Dual Fuel Rod of MOX (4 needed)%n%n1200-2730 EU/t%n%n(This setup is the most efficient per MOX fuel rod, if you're short on fuel, which you shouldn't be if you're doing a MOX setup)%n%nAEAVPVAEA%nVARAVARAV%nAVAVAVAVA%nEAVARAVAE%nARAVAVARA%nVAEAVAEAV%n%nA - Advanced Heat Vent (26 needed)%nE - Component Heat Exchanger (6 needed)%nV - Component Heat Vent (16 needed)%nR - Quad Fuel Rod of MOX (5 needed)%nP - Reactor Plating (1 needed)%n%n3000-6825 EU/t%n%n(This setup is the most efficient per Advanced Heat Vent)%n

# Quest.3176 - Nuclear Fuel Processing
gtnh.quest3176.name=Nuclear Fuel Processing
gtnh.quest3176.desc=The previous reactor is useless on its own, unfortunately. Even if you have built it fully, there's no way to get fuel that it will accept without making another multi that mixes and processes several chemical mixtures into one, the molten salt that generates all that nuclear energy in the LFTR.%n%nThe multi's name is Reactor Fuel Processing Plant (RFPP), although it's easier to call it the Fuel Refinery. It's a mid-late IV multiblock, like the LFTR, especially due to needing 2 ZPM circuits for the Computer Cube used in the controller's recipe. The other casings are similar to what you've made before, and the tooltip gives a good description of what exactly is needed to build the Fuel Refinery. %n%nWhere to put each casing? The bottom two layers are 3x3, and they take the Structural Blocks. On top of the second layer, in the middle block, make a tower of 5 Fluid Containment Blocks, and then cover these with Sealant Blocks, like you would do in a Multiblock Miner. However, the second layer of the 5, from the bottom, uses Reactor Shielding Blocks, 4 of them there instead of the Sealant Blocks. Use the Hologram Projector for assistance if you're having trouble.%n%nWhen it's fully built, you can focus on the recipes. Out of the 5 that are available, you can only do one at this time, the Fuel 1 recipe. To make this fuel, you need molten U235, but also Lithium Fluoride, Beryllium Fluoride and Zirconium Tetrafluoride. Each of the these elements can be obtained with relative ease, each in their own way, but Fluorine is the main part of all this, the main component of the molten salt, so it's a good idea to have a decent source of it. However, the LFTR fuels are also very, very energy dense, so each bucket of Fluorine can bring you a long way.%n%nIf you're looking through NEI, your first response might be "There are no recipes for these fluorides other than reprocessing the depleted fuels! How am I supposed to make these?". The answer is in the dusts: you have to craft the dusts and then fluid extract them into the fluids. There is a spreadsheet which has all the steps in crafting and reprocessing (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1JGSt5-ELdra6emngUc7XvKSJc-_-RO0yreRIbOrx0/edit?usp=sharing), to help with how complicated this chain is. %n%nJust make sure you remember, each bucket of fuel is worth many millions, perhaps even billions of EU! Don't let the 207M EU cost per bucket of Fuel 1 discourage you, it turns into much more energy in the LFTR. Besides, this first fuel is just a stepping stone, so don't worry about fully automating everything just yet, the final setup is different from this one.

# Quest.3177 - Inputs and Outputs in the LFTR
gtnh.quest3177.name=Inputs and Outputs in the LFTR
gtnh.quest3177.desc=Assuming you have both the LFTR and the Fuel Refinery built, and the inputs for the fuel available to be used, you can power up the reactor and leave it running. The first fuel you can use will work with 4 IV Energy Dynamos to output 4 IV amps, as long as the reactor runs, and each cycle lasts for 100 seconds (you can see the recipes on NEI, there's a tab dedicated to the 3 fuels the LFTR can run and what you get from them).%n%nWhat about everything else? The entire setup has 2 inputs and 4 outputs. One of the inputs is any of the 3 possible fuels, the other input is Lithium Tetrafluoroberyllate (LTFB). On the output side, there's one constant: U233 is output in small quantities at random, averaging 10 seconds per output. There are two other outputs, U Salt and UF6, that come from every fuel, although better fuels output more of these per cycle. Finally, T Salt or TB Salt can be outputted, the first from the first fuel and the second from the other two, with TB being more valuable than T. All of these are meant to be processed in order to reach better LFTR fuels, and also useful breeding byproducts.%n%nStarting with the first fuel, every bucket of it will need 2 buckets of LTFB, last 1000 seconds and output a total of 655.536.000 EU at 32.768 EU/t. After this, you will have 367L of U233 on average, 250L of U Salt, 500L of T Salt and 5L of UF6. As you can tell, this is a slow burner, and one bucket of each of these fluids is worth a lot!

# Quest.3178 - First Steps in Reprocessing
gtnh.quest3178.name=First Steps in Reprocessing
gtnh.quest3178.desc=You now have 4 different fluid outputs running away from your LFTR. Each of them needs specific attention, and all of them are useful. %n%nWhere to start looking? The best way to start is at the end, which is to say, the Fuel Refinery. You want to upgrade to the better fuels as soon as possible, and each one has 2 recipes: one with 4 inputs, similar to the recipe you've already done, and one with 2 inputs, focusing on LFTR Fuel Base. The 2-input recipes produce 10x the fuel, so they're much better, but you can't use this recipe alone. The Fuel Base can only be made from reprocessing depleted fuel, and you don't get enough of it to make the same amount of fuel spent. If you perfectly reprocess any of the first two fuels to get Fuel Base, you will come out short and run out of fuel.%n%nGiven that, your strategy will be to use two Fuel Refineries, one for each Fuel 2 recipe, and then change them to Fuel 3 once you've built the Assembly Line, which is required to build the final multiblocks in this line. For Fuel 2, get as much Fuel Base as you can from this chain - EBF <- DT <- RPU <- LFTR and put it into one of the refineries, while using the second one to top off on the remaining fuel you need to keep the LFTR going. You can limit the UF4 on the second refinery to not make too much fuel there, or just turn it on and off, and use as much of the better recipe as possible. You will be able to use the better recipe 100% of the time, but only after building a Sparge Tower.%n%nAdditional details on the other outputs you can get from reprocessing can be found on the breeding side of this questline branch.

# Quest.3179 - Second Half of LFTR Breeding
gtnh.quest3179.name=Second Half of LFTR Breeding
gtnh.quest3179.desc=There are two gas inputs that the Sparge Tower accepts: Helium and Fluorine. Each one works on different depleted salts (U Salt, T Salt, TB Salt) in a specific way. Helium works with U Salt to make the most valuable byproducts, while Fluorine works with the other two salts to make other byproducts and TF4, which is required to make the LFTR Fuel 3. Here, we'll focus on Helium and U Salt, and the other recipes will be covered on the powergen side of the branch.%n%nAll the U Salt you get from the LFTR, from any fuel, can be ran through the Sparge Tower. It's an additional step that is slow, yet rewarding. The recipe is HV-tier, but it's recommended that you overclock it, and maybe even build multiple towers to accelerate it. All the U Salt you have should pass through these, because sparging it outputs almost every noble gas! Xenon, Neon, Argon, Krypton and Radon will be outputted over time, precious gases to speed up EBF recipes and save up lots of energy, and also for the Void Miner. Radon, on the other hand, is required to make Quantum Eyes, Quantum Stars and many other important items.%n%nEven though you get many gases, the speed at which you'll get them isn't great, since it depends on the speed at which LFTR fuel is being consumed. This should not be your only source of these gases, but it is a completely EU-free way to get them, considering the amount of energy the LFTR produces.

# Quest.3180 - Faster Lutetium Excitement
gtnh.quest3180.name=Faster Lutetium Excitement
gtnh.quest3180.desc=This quest is late LuV.%n%nYou might have read before that Lutetium is necessary as an input for fusion crafting. In a tier 2 fusion reactor, Lutetium + Chrome = Americium, a required material for many required crafts. Lutetium is a material that is obtained exclusively from breeding, so you're in the right place to find ways to get it.%n%nThe very first method, EV's IC2 Thorium nukes, is the cheapest, but also the slowest. Each fuel rod takes 50000 seconds to deplete, almost 14 hours, with half of a Lutetium Dust per depleted rod. Highly stackable designs, such as the 2-chamber 11 quad rod one, will grant you 22 dust per cycle. After building 10 of those, the rate is still 16 dust per hour. This processing speed isn't good enough to keep progressing forever, and there is no need to make more towers of breeder nukes. Instead, make liquid fuel.%n%nJust like before, you want to deplete it. The slowest step in the process takes 2500 seconds per bucket, but one bucket of depleted Thorium Based Liquid Fuel awards, on average, 96 Lutetium Dust. This is 138 per hour at the slowest rate! One Neutron Activator matches the speed of 86 of the IC2 nukes mentioned above, and that Neutron Activator is one of the two expensive parts of this multi. The other one is a tier 1 Fusion Reactor to make Helium Plasma and activate the Thorium Liquid Fuel.%n%nSo, you need Lutetium for fusion, but need fusion for this Lutetium? Yes, Helium Plasma is t1 fusion while the Americium recipe is only t2, so you have some time to accumulate Lutetium at a faster rate if you haven't done it already. To accomplish this, you will need a Precise Assembler to make the Neutron Activator, plus the MkI Fusion Reactor, and also some of the Naquadah line in the middle.

# Quest.3181 - Uranium and Plutonium Excitement
gtnh.quest3181.name=Uranium and Plutonium Excitement
gtnh.quest3181.desc=If you've done IC2 nukes, you must have seen this coming. The previous quest had fuel that was based on Thorium, so what comes next? Uranium and Plutonium, of course.%n%nThe byproducts you want are obtained directly from the depleted fuel, so the tasks to get through for power and breeding are exactly the same. However, since this part is about breeding, it's worth it to point out that the depleted fuel can be obtained from depleted fuel rods, after being processed in IC2 nukes. This is not the best way to do it, of course, but it bypasses the need for the Large Naquadah Reactor, an expensive multi even by ZPM standards. You will not get as much power if you don't use that multi, but you can get byproducts all the same.%n%nThe outputs themselves are quite interesting, or at least Plutonium's outputs are. Uranium will give you Lead, Bismuth (almost none), Cerium and a tiny bit of Xenon, which means that you get some Cerium and Xenon. Plutonium, on the other hand, awards you with Tritanium! This is a t2 fusion material that normally needs a lot of Radon to produce, alongside 2 separate fusion recipes, so it might be very useful to source Tritanium through the depleted Plutonium Liquid Fuel. If you do so, you'll also get some Krypton, with each bucket of depleted fuel outputting more than a 100 million Liquid Air recipe on the Distillation Tower, which is also true for the Xenon obtained from Uranium despite the very small amount obtained from it.

# Quest.3182 - High Temperature Super Breeder
gtnh.quest3182.name=High Temperature Super Breeder
gtnh.quest3182.desc=Have you heard of pebble reactors? There's a quest for the other one, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor, on the powergen side of this branch, but this is a diferent multiblock. %n%nIt's called the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR), and it uses fuel pebbles and consumes power. However, it doesn't really make a lot of power, and doesn't even match the EU/t of the other version, despite being much more expensive. The multiblock structure is basically the same, a huge reactor around 12x12x12 blocks in size, with 500+ casings made with Europium. What it doesn't make in power, it compensates in breeding, however.%n%nFor the unaware, this is expensive. Pebble reactors work by stuffing the reactor absolutely full of pebbles, and then the reaction will keep going for, essentially, forever. In this case, you will have a fully automated source of almost endless Lutetium, Plutonium and other things that will be explained in the following quests, alongside the production of fuel and the processing of outputs. What this means is that this is an expensive multiblock, but it's placed a tier in which this expense is actually reasonable, if there is a need for immense, endless breeding of many outputs.%n%nIf you're on the fence about building this, check the next quests to learn more about the fuel and outputs.%n%nNotes:%n%nHTGR has an internal buffer for fuel and only one input bus is required (any will do), as well as only one output bus (reactor automatically compresses every 64 burned pellets into one ball, so you need 6 slots or more to avoid problems with voiding at full capacity).%n%nReactor requires only 72k out of 720k pebbles to operate, but running at minimum capacity means that you will not get any bonuses, such as lower recipe time and higher amount of pebbles processed per cycle.%n%nThis multi consumes 1A LuV when operating, no matter how many pebbles are inside, but it also generates Hot Coolant as it runs. If you use it to generate power, you will gain more EU than is consumed by the reactor. %n%nIn this reactor, the throughput increases with the amount of pebbles put into it.%n%nBy typing HTGR in NEI, you can see all the items that are related to this multiblock.

# Quest.3183 - Exciting Liquid Nuking
gtnh.quest3183.name=Exciting Liquid Nuking
gtnh.quest3183.desc=With the reactor built, it's time to automate the fuel and additives, since there are additives this time. They are optional, so let's begin with the required inputs.%n%nLiquid Air is trivial to automate: it's a Vacuum Freezer job. Input energy and Air and output Liquid Air, there are quests for this. The fuels themselves are more complicated, but the three of them follow a similar set of recipes. First, you grab a lot of the radioactive element (Thorium, Uranium or Plutonium), wrap it in a specific foil and then put in an Implosion Compressor to make very dense nuggets. These are into the High Density items you need, which are then mixed with specific dusts to create the basic fuel fluid.%n%nThis part is where it becomes complicated, though. To get the energy out of this radioactive fluid, you need to activate it. Thorium is done by mixing with Helium Plasma (t1 fusion), while the other two are made directly in the Fusion Reactor (t2 fusion). The activated fuels can be thrown directly in the reactor to produce EU, at a very slow pace. Your bottleneck should be the main radioactive element, so make sure you can source it fast enough.%n%nBeing here, you should have a Large Naquadah Reactor ready to go. However, it is true that these Excited Fuels can be used to make fuel rods for IC2 nukes, with much larger heat outputs meant for fluid nukes. You can try to use them there, but there are no simulated setups of any kind for those rods, so it's going to be a very experimental setup if you ever decide to make it.

# Quest.3184 - The Fission Finale
gtnh.quest3184.name=The Fission Finale
gtnh.quest3184.desc=Here we are, at the end of fission.%n%nAt this time, you have more than entered the fusion tiers. In fact, the last fusion setups go as deep as t2 fusion, so you might be running both fission and fusion at the same time, although the latter is generally easier and more efficient once the structure is built.%n%nOne of the ultimate goals of fission is a filled HTGR, or its younger brother, the THTR, two very expensive multis that can grant you essentially infinite power or breeding products. However, the Naquadah Generator that has those excited nuclear fuels can do much more! The Naquadah fuel line is the reason why it was created, and it can replace t3 fusion and beyond by condensing powergen even more than fusion did, and replace the turbine spam.%n%nThose fuels aren't exactly nuclear fission, nor fusion, and more of a chemical line, so they were not included here. If interested, look at NEI to see what they have to offer.

# Quest.3185 - Pebble Reactor Fuels and Outputs
gtnh.quest3185.name=Pebble Reactor Fuels and Outputs
gtnh.quest3185.desc=Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium. There you go, quest done, onwards. I do find it kind of funny how it always goes back to these. Why is it that when there are problems, it's always you three?%n%nMaking the pebbles for any of these elements is a multi-step process. To get them, you need to throw in huge amount of the main radioactive fuel alongside some materials used to make the outer shell, namely Carbon, Silicon, and Graphite Dust.%n%nFor a full reactor, you will need thousands of stacks of each of these, much more than quest tasks could ask for. Anyways, the depleted pebbles can be centrifuge to recover most of the materials used to reach the final pebbles (Silicon, Graphite, Carbon), alongside a smaller chance at getting the main nuclear material for each kind of pebble. On top of that, you will get the breeding outputs: Lutetium from Thorium, Krypton from Uranium, Xenon from Plutonium.

# Quest.3186 - Tin Plasma From T2
gtnh.quest3186.name=Tin Plasma From T2
gtnh.quest3186.desc=Once you upgrade your Fusion Reactor to tier 2, you gain access to a better recipe for power generation, which is Tin Plasma. Helium-3 is used, as it was before, but now with Silver, which you can automate in a million ways. The processing speed is slightly higher than before, but the fuel value of this plasma is much higher than what you were using before, at 304,496,000 EU per bucket. This impressive fuel value means that the max power output of a single t2 reactor at 100% fuel efficiency is 2,740,464 EU/t, and with the turbines you can use here, you can twice as much as that or even more!%n%nTo utilize all of the plasma, you will be using 10 or more turbines with good rotors. Before doing that, though, it's a good idea to step back and test your turbines with this plasma, preferably in Creative mode, because the fuel value is so high that one liter of plasma is worth 304,496 EU at 100% efficiency. If you set the input rate to anything higher than 1 L/t, you will go above the ZPM Dynamo limit, and even 1 L/t will be too high if the turbine's efficiency is 175% or above! Until you upgrade your hatches, you might once again be stuck will less power output or efficiency than you'd like. There's only one way to fix that.

# Quest.3187 - Two Million Turbines
gtnh.quest3187.name=Two Million Turbines
gtnh.quest3187.desc=Hopefully, not more than a handful. The objective here is for each of them to output close to 2 million EU/t.%n%nHow can you get there? Look at the UV Dynamo Hatch's recipe and you have your new objective. When you arrive there, each turbine that is equipped with that impressive block will be able to output up to 2,097,152 EU/t, which again opens you up to new turbine opportunities. Some good choices at this point are as follows:%n%nLarge Cosmic Neutronium 220% 1,330,560 EU/t%nLarge Awakened Draconium 190% 478,800 EU/t%nLarge Trinium 180% 1,452,520 EU/t%n%nAt this point, you might consider building more t1 Fusion Reactors to process other materials. Even if you stop the reactor you're using to generate this plasma, the EU cost of restarting it is less than 1 bucket of plasma, so it's probably not that big of a deal.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UV dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest.3188 - The Overclocking of the Ages
gtnh.quest3188.name=The Overclocking of the Ages
gtnh.quest3188.desc=Tin Plasma is more power-dense, but it's not a required upgrade. As you scale up, it's always worth it to look back at Helium Plasma for how renewable it is, something that Tin Plasma has unfortunately lost a bit of. It can be made renewable, but one of its strengths was in the Molecular Transformer recipe that transformed Tin, the output, into Silver, one of the inputs. This recipe is now in the new Molecular Transformer Multiblock and does not scale as well as before. Therefore it might be easier to use void miners for silver or to stick with Helium Plasma.%n%nAs per usual, running a lower tier recipe awards you with an overclock. Unlike other GT machines, though, the Fusion Reactor's overclock doubles both speed and energy consumption, which maintains the energy consumption per recipe but gives only half of a speed boost that a perfect overclock (like the Large Chemical Reactor) would. This means that a t2 reactor can produce exactly twice as much power as a t1 in the form of plasma output, but the upgrade is bigger than that when taking better turbines into account.%n%nWhat comes next, then? Tier 3 is what is next. There is no new fuel to be used here, your options are either 4x speed on Helium or 2x speed on Tin. After getting the cheaper Americium recipe that's available on t3, you will be able to make more reactors at a cheaper cost, but this lack of fuel upgrade will still be problematic in your progression. You will have to find other ways to upgrade your power, which will be revealed after this.

# Quest.3189 - Fusing Americium and Tritanium
gtnh.quest3189.name=Fusing Americium and Tritanium
gtnh.quest3189.desc=A t2 Fusion Reactor unlocks more fusion materials, some of which will again be necessary to progress into the next tiers. One of them is Americium, which is the reason for all the Lutetium worry until now: both are required, because one makes the other. The recipe also needs Chrome as input, but that should be much easier to get than Lutetium or the power needed per bucket of Molten Americium, which is almost 300M EU. %n%nYou will need many stacks of this material for your future progression, but your first goal should be to make 141 ingots (check the ZPM "Making Americium" quest for details). However, if you have extra Lutetium, you should make more Americium, you will not regret doing this when you need more of it later.%n%nAnother useful material you unlock at t2 is Tritanium, which is different from Trinium. The source of this material is fusion, and the inputs to make it are Duranium and Titanium. If you haven't made Duranium before, you'll see that it needs a lot of Radon, almost 8x the amount of Tritanium you end up with. For this, you should already have the Radon loop automated, that step is very important for this.%n%nYou will need Tritanium to progress, just as you need Americium, so it's a good idea to batch craft both of these in your new t2 Fusion Reactor so you don't have to go back to these recipes soon.

# Quest.3190 - Bismuth Plasma For Soldering
gtnh.quest3190.name=Bismuth Plasma For Soldering
gtnh.quest3190.desc=Who in their right mind would use a plasma to solder things together? That's mental. Well, this entire progression at this point is mental, that's all there is to it.%n%nIt's not directly with the plasma, though. It is once again about the Mutated Living Solder, and now its fluid inputs: Tin Plasma and Bismuth Plasma. These are the two main components of the previous solders, and that's the reason they're there. Tin Plasma is t2 fusion, and you might have already made a lot of it to generate power, but Bismuth Plasma is t3, with the inputs being Zinc Plasma and Molten Tantalum, which is actually Tritium, Copper and Tantalum in the end. %n%nThe recipes are cheap in power, you just have to make sure the inputs are there. Tritium can be centrifuged from Deuterium, which itself can be centrifuged from Hydrogen Gas, and the other two inputs are easy. You will need 18000L of each plasma for 40000L of the solder, or almost half the amount for each.

# Quest.3191 - Optional Tier 2 Fusion
gtnh.quest3191.name=Optional Tier 2 Fusion
gtnh.quest3191.desc=Uranium - from Gold + Aluminium or Magnesium + Mercury. You should have already left nuclear fission behind, but if you ever need Uranium, you can use this? You should have a lot of it already.%n%nPlutonium - from Helium + Uranium. A quick 1:1 conversion from U238 to P239, but you already have access to Plutonium Ore, so this is probably pointless.%n%nCalifornium - from Beryllium + Plutonium. Mostly used for Oganesson, not very useful for anything else, and you won't need a lot of this if replicating Oganesson is an option.%n%n(These 3 recipes makes a possible chain to Oganesson, which can be made in t3 fusion. Not that they are necessarily the best option to get it.)%n%nExcited Uranium Fuel - from Hydrogen and Uranium Liquid Fuel. This is for the Naquadah Generator, which is late ZPM, or possibly to use in IC2 nukes, although that's the worse option. Basically, it's accelerated nuclear fission, if you have interest in that.%n%nExcited Plutonium Fuel - from Hydrogen and Plutonium Liquid Fuel. Same as above, but from Plutonium. This means it's more expensive, but also more powerful, and can yield a lot of power in the Naquadah Generator with the right additives.

# Quest.3192 - Infinite Turbines
gtnh.quest3192.name=Infinite Turbines
gtnh.quest3192.desc=Some turbine materials are not available for you, either because you don't have the material itself or because the Dynamo Hatch in the turbine cannot handle the power output from plasma. It will be a different story in UHV, when you can once again quadruple the max output of each turbine, and also unlock Infinity as an option for turbines.%n%nLarge Infinity 270% 4,354,560 EU/t%nLarge Infinity Catalyst 200% 806,400 EU/t%n%nYes, that's basically it. You can use any material from the previous turbine quests, but when you make the t8 rocket and can mine Infinity Catalyst, these are the two options. Obviously, Infinity is much better, but also much more expensive. If you stick with fusion, you will need several of those to push through the endgame. Remember that you can input plasma beyond the optimal flow, and get more out of each turbine at the cost of fuel efficiency.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UHV dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest.3193 - Optional Tier 3 Fusion
gtnh.quest3193.name=Optional Tier 3 Fusion
gtnh.quest3193.desc=Indium - from Lithium + Silver. This is one of the most important optional fusion recipes, given how difficult Indium is to get. Your options are to either replicate it, make it with fusion, obtain it from the naquadria line, or obtain it from processing sphalerite ore.%n%n(You can make Indium in other ways, of course, but this is a relatively popular, non-forced fusion recipe)%n%nOganesson - from Calcium + Californium. This is the best noble gas of them all, and a very power-hungry recipe compared to most. However, Oganesson will save you power on EBF recipes, reducing recipe time more than any other fluid, and it also boosts Void Miners to their maximum speed. Replicating it, if possible, is easier than producing more through fusion.%n%nAmericium - from Hydrogen + Plutonium 241. This is the cheaper Americium recipe that was promised to you in t2, and it no longer needs Lutetium. You should be able to get both of the inputs very easily, so enjoy your cheaper Americium!%n%nNeutronium - from Naquadria + Americium. Neutronium fusion? You probably won't need to use this, but it is a source other than ores that you can try.

# Quest.3194 - Smaller Fusion Is Bigger
gtnh.quest3194.name=Smaller Fusion Is Bigger
gtnh.quest3194.desc=It's not smaller, it's compact!%n%nCompact Fusion. If you've been looking for a big multiblock to put together, you have arrived at a very neat thing. There's hardly anything that could beat its size, except for a max height Mega Distillation Tower, but this is instead a wide multi instead of a tall one. It is so wide, in fact, that it cannot fit in one chunk, and instead covers a 3x3 chunk space! Make sure you follow the instructions and the hologram properly, and jump in joy when you have one of these built.%n%nYou can choose one of four tiers for this reactor, in the same way as the normal Fusion Reactors. The Compact controller will need 48 of the regular controllers in the same tier, plus some other materials, and more than 2 thousand blocks in the structure, which are conveniently detailed in the tooltip. It is much bigger than the previous reactors, but it also has a huge number of parallels, starting at 64x with t1 and ending at a maximum of 256x with t4! %n%nThis is the go-to when you have found yourself deep into t3 fusion, perhaps even t4, and you find yourself running short on power. Instead of making a tower of reactors, why not make one of these? The only power issue that you'll have after getting it done is the amount of turbines you will need to eat up all the plasma.

# Quest.3195 - Thorium Tetrafluoride and Fuel 3
gtnh.quest3195.name=Thorium Tetrafluoride and Fuel 3
gtnh.quest3195.desc=Whether you've mathed it out from NEI, looked at the spreadsheet or done something else, you might have figured something out: Fuel 3 is better in every way. More power, more byproducts, more everything. However, both recipes for it use Thorium Tetrafluoride (TF4), and the source of this is salt sparging, done in the Sparge Tower. Not only that, but Fuel 3 can only be consumed by having 4 LuV Buffered Dynamo Hatches in the LFTR, which means that it's a fair bit away from the previous steps in this chain.%n%nOnce you've made it there, though, you can start working on getting this fuel. To make it, you will need at least one Sparge Tower dedicated to using Fluorine, with T Salt or TB Salt (TB Salt is better, get it from Fuel 2). There is a recipe that uses Helium, but it's not required for Fuel 3 and is meant for byproducts, so the quest for it is in the breeding half of this branch. Using a single tower for both recipes is a bad idea, so don't do it!%n%nPreferably, you should input Fluorine and TB Salt and let it run for a while. Speeding up the recipe by overclocking and making more towers is a good idea, since the TF4 is your bottleneck now. Alongside it, you get several fluorides: Lithium, Neptunium, Technetium and Selenium. These might prove useful in the future, but your goal is the Thorium one.

# Quest.3196 - Naquadah Reactor For Nuclear Fuels
gtnh.quest3196.name=Naquadah Reactor For Nuclear Fuels
gtnh.quest3196.desc=What is the most powerful nuclear fission generator there is? The answer to that question isn't even a nuclear fission generator, for the most part. The answer is the Large Naquadah Generator. It follows the same principle as the LFTR, use a new processing chain to turn Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium into liquid fuels, very dense with energy, which are then slowly burned to generate large amounts of power over a very long period of time. This reactor, for example, burns its fuels 1 milibucket at a time, over several seconds, when running without additives, a very slow burner by default.%n%nLet's look at the NEI recipes. Excited Thorium outputs 2,200 EU/t, Excited Uranium outputs 12,960 EU/t and Excited Plutonium outputs 32,400 EU/t. These are small numbers, clearly, so this can't possibly be the most powerful nuclear fission reactor. However, this multi is more complicated than that! In total, there are 4 inputs you can provide for it: one of them is the required fuel and another is the also required Liquid Air to generate EU from that fuel, but the other 2 are additives that are optional, yet increase both the efficiency and the consumption speed of the fuel. The controller's tooltip lists all the possible additives and their bonuses.%n%nFuel efficiency here means that the fuel is burned at the same rate, but energy output is increased by the percentage. Let's consider the two best options, Cryotheum and Atomic Separation Catalyst. They multiply with each other, so the energy output is 2.75 x 16 = 44 times the displayed EU/t on NEI! Excited Plutonium, the most energetic of the three fuels, will award you with 1,425,600 EU/t, almost 3 UV amps.

# Quest.3197 - Maxed-out LFTR
gtnh.quest3197.name=Maxed-out LFTR
gtnh.quest3197.desc=An LuV LFTR running on Fuel 3 outputs 4 ZPM amps per tick, or 524,288 EU/t. Each bucket is worth 1,048,576,000,000 EU, more than a trillion EU! Certainly, this is the most power-dense fuel you've ever held, and now that you've made it here, you can make it to fusion and beyond much more easily. But wait, there's more!%n%nYou might have noticed that the limiting factor in using the best recipe for Fuel 1 and Fuel 2 was the U Salt, which ultimately makes the LFTR Fuel Base. You just can't get enough of it to drop that inefficient 4-input recipe. However, the increased output of U Salt from Fuel 3, alongside the doubling that you can get from processing Helium Sparged U Salt instead of the regular one, means that you can use the 2-input recipe to make all your fuel from now on! If you haven't set up Helium Sparge Towers yet, do so now.%n%nWhen you do this, you can grab the two Fuel Refineries you should have and set them both to the 2-input recipe. Each bucket of Fuel 3 takes 9000 seconds to make, but is consumed in 4000 seconds, so it's good to have more than one Refinery per LFTR. With this, you will make fuel much faster, and generate much more EU than before. If you continue expanding, it's very possible to match the first tiers of fusion power from something like this.

# Quest.3198 - Radioactivity's Additives
gtnh.quest3198.name=Radioactivity's Additives
gtnh.quest3198.desc=The Naquadah Reactor has the potential to be an endgame power generator, but only if the right additives are used. These additives boost the EU/t output of the multi, but in different ways, and it's important to upgrade them as quickly as possible. However, going beyond the max output of the Dynamo Hatch is not a good idea!%n%nThere are two types of additives: the coolants and the fuel boosters. The coolants boost fuel efficiency, which means fuel consumption is the same, whereas the boosters increase the speed the multi burns the fuel, increasing the output at the same time.%n%nThere are three coolants, but the 275% efficiency boost by using Cryotheum should not be ignored. To automate it, you will need an automated source of Blaze Rods and Snowballs (Snow is made from Water). To this, you add Redstone and Saltpeter, and you're done.%n%nThe boosters are more difficult to choose from. Caesium should be ignored, Uranium 235 can be automated from Uranium 238 with magic at an almost 1:1 ratio, but Naquadah is what you probably have ready to use for this, which quadruples the speed of this reactor. However, if this is too slow, you can instead automate Atomic Separation Catalyst to get a 16x speed boost! There are many recipes for this, so choose your favorite.

# Quest.3199 - Automation for Fluid Nukes
gtnh.quest3199.name=Automation for Fluid Nukes
gtnh.quest3199.desc=If you've looked at the wiki setups, you might have seen some that seem harder to automate than others. Particularly, that one with two kinds of Uranium Rods. More than filling empty slots with Reactor Platings to force all the inputs to move to the specific slots where the rods must go, this one needs each rod to go in a specific slot!%n%nThe solution for this is a GT cover. The Robot Arm does the same action of moving items around as the Conveyor, but it moves to specific slots. With this, you can move the Dual Rod to where it needs to be, and the Quad Rods can fill the remaining slots as intended. If you're using other setups, you can use a similar logic to do your automation.

# Quest.3200 - EV vs. IV
gtnh.quest3200.name=EV vs. IV
gtnh.quest3200.desc=Your sourcing of Uranium is gonna be very small in EV, unless you use crops. Similarly, your ability to put together the multiblocks needed for the fluid nuke will be better in IV, since you can mine Small Titanium Ore directly, and use GT++ multis. %n%nAll in all, it becomes very worthwhile to rush the Tier 2 Rocket and land on Mars and Phobos to get Uranium and Tungstate/Scheelite, before you go much farther with IC2 nukes. In IV, fluid nukes are one of the best choices for efficient power without a lot of setup, although it's very viable to use Thorium and not just Uranium.%n%nEither way, it's recommended to have a multiblock Miner in either the Nether or Phobos, to source your Thorium or Uranium.

# Quest.3201 - Thorium vs. Uranium
gtnh.quest3201.name=Thorium vs. Uranium
gtnh.quest3201.desc=Thorium and Uranium have a lot of differences, but also a lot of similarities.%n%nIn general, Uranium is a better fuel, but fluid nukes do not follow that general rule. Because they do not output any EU/t, and simply convert heat to Hot Coolant, the difference between the two fuels becomes minimal and Thorium stands out as being much easier to get and turn into fuel rods. The maximum amount of heat you can safely move around in a reactor limits the amount of Uranium Fuel Rods you can use, which means that your HU value will not be as high as you would have wanted.%n%nFor regular and vacuum IC2 nukes, however, Uranium has a big advantage. Especially in vacuum nukes, which are the most powerful, the efficient cooling through the cells makes it so a lot of Uranium can be processed at once, which returns incredible amounts of EU/t. The different conversion from fuel to energy between fluid and vacuum means that Thorium is very good for fluid nukes, whereas Uranium is very good for vacuum nukes.

# Quest.3202 - Max Danger Nukes
gtnh.quest3202.name=Max Danger Nukes
gtnh.quest3202.desc=Were you courageous enough to build a vac nuke? If so, are you courageous enough to do it in a MOX setup, with high heat?%n%nYes, this is possible, and extremely powerful. However, all the risks you signed up for are exponentially increased, since MOX nukes keep getting better and better the closer the nuke's temperature is to the critical point. This sort of automation is more complicated than almost any other, and I honestly don't have any specific guidelines for you. %n%nIf you manage this, do share it on the Discord. I bet people will be surprised.

# Quest.3203 - Duranium and the Cyclotron
gtnh.quest3203.name=Duranium and the Cyclotron
gtnh.quest3203.desc=In the previous quest, Duranium was introduced as a material used to make Tritanium. While it becomes required for this reason, there is more to it than that. Another recipe that uses it is a Cyclotron recipe, which has a chance to produce a Quantum Anomaly. %n%nFirst off, what is the Cyclotron? That is a multiblock that works a bit like fusion, but only for the purpose of making new materials. It collides single particles with one another, or against fluids, to generate new items while consuming power. Most of the recipes it has won't be very useful, if at all, but it can also make Quantum Anomalies. This is a chance craft, but the Anomaly has a special property: when used to convert some blocks to others, it will not be consumed. Therefore, for that purpose, you only need to get one.%n%nIs this required? Well, yes. When you arrive at a certain stage of the game, you might find yourself needing a new kind of soldering alloy, called Mutated Living Solder. To craft this, you need a Chemical Plant made with Botmium, which is an alloy that required Advanced Nitinol. This, in turn, is one of the blocks that need a Quantum Anomaly for its conversion. Given that Duranium is the only fluid choice to make the Anomaly, then it becomes required for this as well, but only a couple tiers from ZPM.%n%nAdditionally, there are other recipes, like the Elemental Duplicator. This is a very powerful replicator that will give you a great boost in automation due to its speed and the replication recipes it can do, but the Quantum Anomaly used in this recipe will be consumed, so watch out: if you only have one, don't use it for this.

# Quest.3204 - The End of Fusion Materials
gtnh.quest3204.name=The End of Fusion Materials
gtnh.quest3204.desc=There are only so many required fusion materials, which you've already gone through at this point. There are many more recipes, many of which have been listed in the quests so far, but also some that are yet to be tackled.%n%nThis, however, is the endgame. If you look at NEI, there are some recipes with EU/T and start EU values that are higher than what t3 fusion can offer, which suggests that there is yet another tier. The reality is that t4 fusion does exist, but it's more for bragging rights than real usefulness, alongside being much more expensive and harder to make than any of the other reactors. There is a quest for this in the "Endgame Goals" page, should you have unlocked that.%n%nAmong the last materials, you will find Flerovium, Rhugnor and, finally, Hypogen. They don't have a lot of possible uses for most of the pack, but Hypogen becomes essential in the endgame, where it becomes part of the coil block progression, as well as being used in some recipes as wires. If you truly want to walk towards the stargate, you will need to craft many stacks of this.

# Quest.3205 - Reactors are Expensive!
gtnh.quest3205.name=Reactors are Expensive!
gtnh.quest3205.desc=Your first t1 Fusion Reactor is one of the biggest walls to overcome throughout this pack's progression. It's very unlikely you can afford to just build another one right after, so you will have to manage several reactions with that single one.%n%nThe new fusion condition is that you will have to pay a cost of EU and time every time you switch the recipe that's being crafted. Assuming you're using fusion power, the production of Europium and any other material should be batched between your usual rows of power generation. Perhaps you're overproducing power? In that case, you can use the pause to fuse some useful materials.%n%nIn time, you will be able to afford and use multiple fusion reactors. For not, this isn't the case.

# Quest.3206 - Establishment of Fusion
gtnh.quest3206.name=Establishment of Fusion
gtnh.quest3206.desc=Fusion is the lategame. It is not the entire lategame, but several tiers are effectively relying on it, even if new ways of generating power are being discovered (developed) over time. Whether you got here through focusing on power or products, you have surely felt the importance of that donut on your base, have you not?%n%nLet's just hope your power storage doesn't run out when you start relying on Mega Blast Furnace processing.%n%n

# Quest.3207 - A Second Reactor?
gtnh.quest3207.name=A Second Reactor?
gtnh.quest3207.desc=At this point, why not? You should be a in a better position to afford it, but there is the issue that t3 fusion unlocks an easier Americium recipe, which lets you craft a second t3 more easily. You might not want to wait that long, maybe you've been smelting a lot of ingots, or using World Accelerators?%n%nRegardless, two Helium Plasma reactors will surely suffice for whatever it is you're doing. Tin Plasma is worth using, of course, but the Molecular Transformer recipe to convert Silver to Tin isn't available in the singleblock anymore, so you might want the easier option, since you're rocking two reactors and all. With the 2x overclock they're still produce millions of EU/t with the right Plasma Turbines, assuming you have them ready.

# Quest.3208 - Transmutative Rod
gtnh.quest3208.name=Transmutative Rod
gtnh.quest3208.desc=Combining Salis Mundis and some clusters, I can get upgrade a greatwood rod to a transmutative rod. Now that looks like a particularly interesting option!

# Quest.3210 - §6§lAnother Chemical Multiblock?
gtnh.quest3210.name=§6§lAnother Chemical Multiblock?
gtnh.quest3210.desc=You probably have built a lot of Large Chemical Reactors by now. With the powerful 4/4 overclocking it is one of the strongest multiblocks there is. But what if even that is not enough to satisfy your chemical needs? You can't make it faster if the recipe time is already down to 1 tick (=0.05s).%n%nFear not, we have a solution for you: The Mega Chemical Reactor. It lets you do 256 parallels for your LCR recipes! And you can still overclock after that if you provide enough power.%n%nIt only unlocks in LuV as it needs 7 Fusion Coil Blocks. Check with your hologram projector to see how it is built and what you need.%n%nThe glass tier limits the energy hatch tier that you can use. You can even use multiamp hatches from TecTech! If you want to use laser hatches however you need at least UV glass.

# Quest.3211 - §6§lRaw Silicon Dust
gtnh.quest3211.name=§6§lRaw Silicon Dust
gtnh.quest3211.desc=Silicon is needed in all boule (and thus wafers, chips, and circuits) creation. Silicon is therefore an §oincredibly important material§r.%n%nWith your new electrolyzer you can obtain raw silicon dust from many different sources. Alternatively, you can also centrifuge redstone. Or, you can also get your raw silicon from silicon dioxide.

# Quest.3212 - §6§lSilicon Tetrachloride
gtnh.quest3212.name=§6§lSilicon Tetrachloride
gtnh.quest3212.desc=However, the raw silicon dust you obtained is not pure enough! We will need to work on that. Don't worry, this is just a simple two step process. First let us start by reacting it with some chlorine in a chemical reactor.

Maybe its time to add a few.%n%n§3If you have not gotten any strontium yet, you can obtain it from strontium oxide based on Rare Earth 3, from spessartine froth or from a Deep Dark void miner.

# Quest.3217 - §6§lInfinity Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest3217.name=§6§lInfinity Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest3217.desc=Smelting with the ferocity of the universe itself.%n%nThis unbelievable material seemed impossible to manipulate into a coil block form, even though its properties made this desirable. It is incredibly stable even at extreme temperatures, but this also made it unable to pack together for coils.%n%nHowever, the situation changed when you thought about using something more intelligent. By integrating a Wetware or better UHV circuit, the Infinity Coil became a reality, controlled by the ever-watching eyes of the circuitry you've spent months to create. From now on, these eyes will watch over your multiblocks.%n%nProvides 11701 heat. You could upgrade your EBF, though at this point it's more likely to be for your MEBFs or your DTPF.

# Quest.3218 - §6§lHypogen Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest3218.name=§6§lHypogen Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest3218.desc=Forged from the blood of an ageless dragon, and melded together by the power of fusion beyond what you thought was the reality. No natural element, or combination of elements could match up to this glowing orange material, not even the Awakened Draconium you got your hands on before.%n%nWhat truly happened inside that Mk4 Fusion Reactor? What §ois§o§r this material? Its dust pulsates visibly, at different rates depending on the size of the dust itself. Hypogen approaches a state of complete balance as it approaches the block size, and it is obvious to you what needs to be done with it.%n%nIt absorbs and radiates energy without any effort, but it would be stupid to attempt making coils out of this without assistance. Wetware wasn't good anymore, and only the most advanced living circuit could withstand the erratic behavior Hypogen has.%n%nProvides 12601K heat. Almost certainly, this will end up on your DTPF.

# Quest.3219 - §6§lEternal Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest3219.name=§6§lEternal Coil Upgrade
gtnh.quest3219.desc=Beyond spacetime, beyond reality. You have peered into what never existed and brought into a fluid, and then a solid. It has been stabilized, against all odds. When you look at it, you think that you could hold the entire universe in your hand.%n%nIn the past, you were able to combine almost all materials into one, through an Eternal Singularity, an infinitely dense sample of the universe. However, automating this at the scale of the DTPF proved ridiculous, which would have stopped your progress altogether if not for the discovery of the Energized Tesseract. To physically manifest spacetime itself, you first needed to manifest the fourth spatial dimension, and that is what the Tesseract is: a 4-dimensional cube.%n%nCubes! Almost everything around you is made out of cubes. You have only glimpsed at the reality of the 4-dimensional world, but you have successfully used it to condensate spacetime, which can be arbitrarily molded into the complete Eternal mixture, a process that unfortunately cannot be reversed. Needless to say, living circuits will not suffice to maintain an infinitely dense, infinitely stable, multi-dimensional material.%n%nCurrently, the final upgrade with 13501K. This really makes your DTPF shine!

# Quest.3220 - The roots of magic
gtnh.quest3220.name=The roots of magic
gtnh.quest3220.desc=If you're familiar with Botania, you will notice that the overworld is noticeably void of magical flowers and mushrooms. Such pretty expressions of magic sadly require you to have leveled up on your magical skills. For now you will have to make do with what the world has to offer.%n%nLook in deep caves in the Twilight Forest at low Y-levels for glimmering mushrooms. These are your starting ingredient and can be used instead of flower petals. Beware, unlike flowers you can't grow more just yet, so be careful what you use them for.

# Quest.3221 - Flower grafting
gtnh.quest3221.name=Flower grafting
gtnh.quest3221.desc=The first item you want to make is the Petal Apothecary. A mushroom is needed to anoint it and give it its restorative properties.%n%nTo operate it, fill it with a bucket of water to keep the plants hydrated. After that you can add the ingredients by dropping them on top.%n%nEach craft requires some magical ingredients, but also one or more regular flowers from the world that can function as a stable base. Once you've added all the ingredients, finish the craft by adding a seed. Any vanilla seed will do.

# Quest.3222 - Pure Daisy
gtnh.quest3222.name=Pure Daisy
gtnh.quest3222.desc=The first magical flower you are able to make is the Pure Daisy. This flower can slowly enchant nearby stone and logs into basic Botania ingredients.%n%nAfter placing the flower down, you can use put down stone and wood in the 8 tiles around it, and after a certain time they will be converted.

# Quest.3223 - Your first mana pool
gtnh.quest3223.name=Your first mana pool
gtnh.quest3223.desc=Now that you have livingrock, create your first mana pool. Chop some pieces into slabs with a saw to make the bottom, then stick them together with plates for the sides.%n%nYou lack the knowledge to make it effective, so sadly it won't be able to craft a lot as a result.

gtnh.quest3225.name=Pollination buddies
gtnh.quest3225.desc=Some flowers are everywhere, and some are limited to specific biomes. If you don't want to walk long distances from home, you can call in some help.%n%nBees with the flower trait will slowly generate new flowers in its working are, including plenty that have been brought in from distant pastures.

# Quest.3226 - Mana diamonds
gtnh.quest3226.name=Mana diamonds
gtnh.quest3226.desc=Mana diamonds are magically enhanced diamonds, and they require more or less energy depending on the quality of the gem you're trying to enchant.%n%nA completely full diluted pool is barely able to make a mana diamond out of an exquisite diamond. Once you upgrade the pool you can use regular diamonds - be it at a higher mana cost.

# Quest.3227 - A glimpse into a watery future
gtnh.quest3227.name=A glimpse into a watery future
gtnh.quest3227.desc=The next step is to make some catalysts. The Alchemical catalyst can use mana to change one item or block into a related item or block.%n%nPut it under a filled mana pool, then try it out by making some prismarine.%n%nThe recipe will need to be researched in the Thaumonomicon.

# Quest.3228 - Botanic infusion
gtnh.quest3228.name=Botanic infusion
gtnh.quest3228.desc=The infusion altar will allow you to make runes, which in turn gives you access to progressively more advanced flowers.%n%nTo operate the altar, drop the ingredients on top, whack it with a wand of the forest, and when it's done drop a livingrock block on top to complete the craft. You will additionally need a mana source, such as a mana spreader pointing at it.

# Quest.3229 - Terrasteel
gtnh.quest3229.name=Terrasteel
gtnh.quest3229.desc=To get some advanced tools and equipment you will need some terrasteel. This is done using a dedicated machine.

gtnh.quest3231.desc=Put the 4 pylons down and shift right click the terrasteel ingot on the beacon to summon the Gaia Guardian.

# Quest.3232 - Stonks
gtnh.quest3232.name=Stonks
gtnh.quest3232.desc=So the rumours about the elves were true. Well, *were* true. They're still mostly true. and what isn't true used to be true.%n%nTurns out they have since been talking to a person going by the name of Olafe, which has since sparked a industrial revolution in the Elven lands. That sadly means that they now insist on receiving the latest fashion in machinery to fuel their ever-expanding factories, in exchange for the elven materials that are now rapidly going out of fashion.%n%nSomeone needs to have a word with this guy...

# Quest.3233 - You are worthy
gtnh.quest3233.name=You are worthy
gtnh.quest3233.desc=Go no further if you value your sanity.

# Quest.3234 - DTPF
gtnh.quest3234.name=DTPF
gtnh.quest3234.desc=Congratulations, you have reached the Dimensionally Transcendent Plasma Forge, one of the most lategame multiblocks in the pack. This monster will make a MEBF look like a toaster by comparison to the raw smelting power available here.%n%nThis multiblock has numerous powerful recipes at its disposal, including the ability to cook 4,096 neutronium in parallel for a reduced EU cost and the conversion of infinity catalyst directly into infinity at a 1:1 ratio. This comes at a great cost and will likely be a harsh test on your infrastructure.

# Quest.3235 - Power in the Ether
gtnh.quest3235.name=Power in the Ether
gtnh.quest3235.desc=These new hatches allow you to wirelessly send, store and receive energy from any location in any dimension. They can be placed in any existing multi block structure and will function as normal energy/dynamo hatches. A dynamo hatch will consume EU and store it in a global network linked to your user. The wireless network can store a total of 2^(2^31) EU, far exceeding even a max tier LSC.%n%nYou can share a wireless network with others by adding them to your network with /gt global_energy_join user1 user2. This will make user1 use user2's energy when interacting with the global network. You can leave a network at any time by doing /gt global_energy_join your_name your_name. %n%nYou cannot connect wires to these blocks. These are also designed to be highly lag efficient, meaning EU is added at large intervals to prevent needless calculations from occurring. This will also save you some TPS lag from vast wire networks.%n%n§3If your calculator is giving up, 2^(2^31) is a number with 646,456,994 digits.

# Quest.3236 - Nano Circuits
gtnh.quest3236.name=Nano Circuits
gtnh.quest3236.desc=Circuits required for UIV.

gtnh.quest3237.desc=So close.

# Quest.3238 - Space Bees
gtnh.quest3238.name=Space Bees
gtnh.quest3238.desc=Breed an industrious with a heroic bee to obtain a space bee. You need the temperature to be icy for that.%n%nJust one small step for you, but a giant leap for beekind.%n%n§3This is the starting point for many space related bees. Maybe check out NEI to see what you can aim for.

# Quest.3239 - Tesseract
gtnh.quest3239.name=Tesseract
gtnh.quest3239.desc=Engineering beyond your comprehension. Destroying this strange higher dimensional object in a macerator is very easy though.

# Quest.3240 - SpaceTime
gtnh.quest3240.name=SpaceTime
gtnh.quest3240.desc=Reality itself bends to your will.

# Quest.3241 - Round two... FIGHT!
gtnh.quest3241.name=Round two... FIGHT!
gtnh.quest3241.desc=Now craft a Gaia Spirit ingot with your new Gaia Spirit from killing the Gaia guardian.%n%nPut the 4 pylons down and shift right click the Gaia Spirit ingot on the beacon to summon a harder version of Gaia Guardian.

# Quest.3242 - UMV Circuits
gtnh.quest3242.name=UMV Circuits
gtnh.quest3242.desc=Circuits required for UMV tier.

# Quest.3243 - Finally, you are here.
gtnh.quest3243.name=Finally, you are here.
gtnh.quest3243.desc=Well done, you have reached the highest craftable parts in the game.

gtnh.quest3245.desc=Endgame power source.

# Quest.3246 - Runes
gtnh.quest3246.name=Runes
gtnh.quest3246.desc=Craft some runes, because why not?

# Quest.3247 - Tool: Never complete
gtnh.quest3247.name=Tool: Never complete
gtnh.quest3247.desc=This quest should never be complete which is useful to hide templates and other things.

# Quest.3248 - Dragonblood
gtnh.quest3248.name=Dragonblood
gtnh.quest3248.desc=For your first batch of Hypogen you will need some Dragonblood. Maybe you already have some lying around somewhere from killing the dragon a long time ago. You have 2 other options though. Bees and the DE Fusion Crafter.%n%nFor the bee path you have to go very deep into the breeding tree, but maybe you have already done that? Check the Bee Breeding tab either way.%n%nIn the DE Fusion Crafter you have 2 recipes. The better one uses an Infinity Egg from Witchery. Without any Witchery you can also just a normal dragon egg for the weaker recipe.%n%nOnce you have a bit of Hypogen you can then use that as a starting point to make more in your DTPF without any Dragonblood. I don't know why it works that way, complain to Colen.%n%nHowever, you will still need more Dragonblood eventually for UMV superconductors.%n%n%n§3There is actually another way to get Dragonblood which is similar to the DE Fusion Crafter recipes but in the mixer instead. Its even slower and less resource efficient. In particular, the dragon egg does not survive the process. So only use that if you are absolutely trying to avoid magic and bees.%n%nJust a reminder: a fluid task just needs you to have the fluid in some container in your inventory. (cell, universal cell, large cell, volumetric cell, etc.)

# Quest.3249 - Wait, PBI wasn't the last plastic?
gtnh.quest3249.name=Wait, PBI wasn't the last plastic?
gtnh.quest3249.desc=Let's make a brand new plastic! The trees that you found on Barnada C have very interesting properties. Still, you can't just use the extracted radox substance raw. Some serious refining steps are in order!%n%n§6You'll need it for a ton of stuff like UIV and UMV superconductors, UEV+ hatches, or parts of the Dyson Swarm.§r%n%nCompared to the previous plastics, most of the steps required here are not chemical reactions. They are also very slow, so you might want to use a mega multiblock to help with that. This production line also underlines the necessity of large-scale plasma production. You will only need more going forward.%n%n§3The Heavy Radox you get as a byproduct can be used for MkV Naquadah Fuel.

# Quest.3250 - AE2 Fluid Crafting
gtnh.quest3250.name=AE2 Fluid Crafting
gtnh.quest3250.desc=Well well well, what do we have here? Flasks are redundant now? NO WAY! %nAnyway, while you can listen to those who swear flasks are *the shit* and *the only way* you can automate fluid crafting and Assline, you can use this powerful addon backported by GlodBlock. All praise our king!%n%nNow, what do you need to get that juicy stuff working?%nEvery ME System needs a Fluid Discretizer. It allows for on demand crafting. While you can use AE2FC without Fluid Discretizer for moving fluids, you need a Discretizer for autocrafting.%n%nThen you also need a fluid terminal or a fluid processing terminal for assembly line. %n%nWhen creating patterns you will notice your fluids being placed as if they were items. %nYour finished patterns will look blue-ish. Placing those in a Dual Interface will allow AE2 to push the fluids and items both. Note. Fluids are being sent first, then items.%nYou can switch the dual interface on the top right if you want it to keep fluids in stock. %n%nIf you use a blue pattern (fluid pattern) in a normal interface, AE2 will send the fluid as a fluid packet. This is just a representation of the fluid as an item. A fluid decoder can turn it back into a fluid and saves it in the fluid grid.%nWe use this feature for Assline. %n%nYou can use an ingredient buffer (large or normal) so your items and fluids sent by a pattern can get stored internally in one block. The normal buffer can hold 9 items and 4 fluids whereas the large one can hold 27 items and 7 fluids.%nYou can use it to automate multiblocks with e.g item and fluid conduits. %n%nIf you want to automate single blocks its as easy as eating chocolate cake while on your diet:%nMake the pattern, make an interface, boom- done!%nIt will automatically insert the fluid in the fluid inventory of a single block machine. %n%nAutomating Assembly line is easy. It follows the typical flask setup but replaces tanks with fluid decoders and a fluid storage bus to insert the fluids. Also we are sending fluids first, then items by using the priority button (made by Runakai and Rukern) in the fluid processing terminal. Make sure to give the decoders their own sub-mes. If you need more detailled information, visit the wiki:%n%nhttps://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/AE2FC%n%nYou can use ExtraCells and AE2FC in combination. However, AE2FC cells are recommended. There is no Fluid Monitor or Storage Bus from AE2FC so use ExtraCells for those. %n

# Quest.3251 - The Final Goal
gtnh.quest3251.name=The Final Goal
gtnh.quest3251.desc=Thanks to your help I have managed to create the ultimate energy source: An encased wormhole that drains energy from a synthesized pocket universe, to the point when it reaches heat death. I have no use for it, so you may have it. Thank you for making my dream come true!

# Quest.3252 - What are all these flowers even for?
gtnh.quest3252.name=What are all these flowers even for?
gtnh.quest3252.desc=If you've never used Botania before, you may be wondering about the purpose of all this effort. This isn't a simple question to answer, but one thing you can do that's quite useful right now is making yourself some manasteel.%n%nAmong its many uses, manasteel has one of the best, if not simply §othe§o §rbest, durabilities of materials available at LV, so it's perfect for all of your crafting tools.%n%nIf you have a particular dislike of Tinker's Construct, manasteel is a great material to make a Gregtech pickaxe out of too.

# Quest.3253 - Moron's Manual for Mana Manufacture And Manipulation
gtnh.quest3253.name=Moron's Manual for Mana Manufacture And Manipulation
gtnh.quest3253.desc=To use the power of magical flowers, you must understand how to generate and manipulate mana. This ethereal blue-ish substance is produced by generating flowers, when their requirements are met. Mana is not easily quantified, so you will have to do a lot of estimating if you want to use it efficiently.%n%nOnce you have chosen which flower you want to use to generate mana, you must plant it near a mana spreader. When the flower's conditions are fulfilled, it will begin to produce mana, and store it in the internal buffer of the nearest mana spreader. The mana spreader itself will automatically emit any mana it contains, provided it is aimed at a valid destination (such as a mana pool). You'll need a lot of these devices, so craft a pair for now.%n%nMana spreaders will aim towards you when you place them down. To change their direction, use a wand of the forest: while holding the wand, shift+right click on the mana spreader, and then shift+right click on the block you want it to aim at. This method of binding also works for other things, such as binding a flower to a specific mana spreader.

# Quest.3254 - Solar Power: Floral Edition
gtnh.quest3254.name=Solar Power: Floral Edition
gtnh.quest3254.desc=The daybloom is an extremely simple generating flower. All you have to do is place it down, and it'll produce mana for free during the day. The downside of this arrangement is that dayblooms die after only an hour. Make one, and I'll give you another.

# Quest.3255 - Hydrobotanic Energy
gtnh.quest3255.name=Hydrobotanic Energy
gtnh.quest3255.desc=Mana is blue. Water is also blue. There's a correlation there, and the hydroangea turns that correlation into causation. Place a water source block nearby, and the hydroangea will consume it to produce mana - until it dies after an hour.%n%nThis one can be a bit tricky to automate given the lack of naturally-regenerating source blocks.

# Quest.3256 - Dark Energy
gtnh.quest3256.name=Dark Energy
gtnh.quest3256.desc=Perhaps not the kind of "dark energy" you're familiar with, the nightshade produces mana at night. Like other passive generating flowers, it dies after an hour.

# Quest.3257 - Is this a combustion generator?
gtnh.quest3257.name=Is this a combustion generator?
gtnh.quest3257.desc=The endoflame burns combustible materials in order to produce mana. It can efficiently consume fuels with a burn time of up to 64000 per item (equivalent to four blocks of coal); any burn time beyond this will be wasted. Endoflames don't die like passive flowers do, and are simple to use, so it's a good idea to make several of them.

# Quest.3258 - A Botanist's Best Friend
gtnh.quest3258.name=A Botanist's Best Friend
gtnh.quest3258.desc=Functional flowers are a large part of Botania. Most of them have nuances to how they operate, and these are generally best explained in the Lexica Botania: a codex of all Botania knowledge. This questline will explain the basics, but be sure to keep a copy of the Lexica Botania on hand so you can easily reference the details.%n%nBesides being a repository of useful information, the Lexica Botania has another function: if, while holding it, you look at any Botania block in the world, you can shift+right click on that block to open up the relevant page.%n%nSomething else you'll want for functional flowers is a handful of redstone roots. Flowers which have a redstone root in their recipe have the ability to toggle whether they are active by applying a redstone signal. Make a few before you move on.

# Quest.3259 - Anti-Magnetism
gtnh.quest3259.name=Anti-Magnetism
gtnh.quest3259.desc=If you've made a ring of magnetization, you may be getting tired of having to take it off around various Botania systems that require items to be on the ground in order to interact with flowers. The solegnolia is your solution to that. Simply place one down anywhere you don't want items to be automatically put in your inventory, and the ring of magnetization will be disabled while you're in the vicinity of the solegnolia. It doesn't even require mana!

# Quest.3260 - Violence Is Blue
gtnh.quest3260.name=Violence Is Blue
gtnh.quest3260.desc=The dreadthorne is similar to the bellethorne, but it only kills adult animals. This is helpful for farming livestock, though it's only one aspect of a successful farm.

# Quest.3261 - Roses Are Blood-Red
gtnh.quest3261.name=Roses Are Blood-Red
gtnh.quest3261.desc=The bellethorne is a delightful little flower with an §c§c§r§4insatiable thirst for blood§r, though fortunately your blood doesn't count. When provided with a supply of mana, it will inflict damage on any living entities near it, with the exception of players. It's a good extra layer of defence to place at the entrances to your early-game bamboo fortress.

# Quest.3262 - Magic Blue Dust
gtnh.quest3262.name=Magic Blue Dust
gtnh.quest3262.desc=You'll need mana powder to proceed. Make four to start out with.

# Quest.3263 - Better Generating Flowers
gtnh.quest3263.name=Better Generating Flowers
gtnh.quest3263.desc=If you want anything better than an endoflame, you'll need a runic altar. Fortunately, most runes are easily crafted as soon as you can make the runic altar. Sinful runes, however, require titanium to make. For now, just make one of each of the elemental runes; that'll be enough to get you started.

# Quest.3264 - Shut down your canning machine
gtnh.quest3264.name=Shut down your canning machine
gtnh.quest3264.desc=Some flowers eat bees. Some eat leaves. Some eat slimes. This one eats everything (everything you can eat, anyway). The gourmaryllis is happiest when provided with a good variety of delicious meals, so I hope the HV-tier diet of canned sludge hasn't made you forget how to cook.

# Quest.3265 - Experienced Botanist
gtnh.quest3265.name=Experienced Botanist
gtnh.quest3265.desc=The rosa arcana transmutes experience into mana. A player standing near it will have their experience drained for this purpose. This process is unfortunately not very practical to automate, as the experience can only be extracted directly from a player, and not from orbs on the ground or any method of storage. It might be wise to place it somewhere you spend a lot of time.

# Quest.3266 - Mmmmmm, Slimy!
gtnh.quest3266.name=Mmmmmm, Slimy!
gtnh.quest3266.desc=Have you ever seen a slime and thought "I'd love to eat that"? The narslimmus has.%n%nIt needs to be planted somewhere slimes can naturally appear, but if you can find a good place for a narslimmus it'll consume those slimes and give you a good amount of mana in return.

# Quest.3267 - Flower!!! Unlimited Flower!!!
gtnh.quest3267.name=Flower!!! Unlimited Flower!!!
gtnh.quest3267.desc=The jaded amaranthus causes mystical flowers to grow all around it. Their vibrant petals can be used for magic, so you no longer have to go foraging for mushrooms.%n%nThere §ois§o§o§r another way of getting these, but you'll have to figure that one out for yourself.

# Quest.3268 - Obligatory Lava Power
gtnh.quest3268.name=Obligatory Lava Power
gtnh.quest3268.desc=The thermalily consumes lava, but it's not quite as simple as just constantly replenishing a lava pool. There's a cooldown that you'll have to account for. Even so, it's a fairly easy flower to automate if you have a good lava source.

# Quest.3269 - Chickenization
gtnh.quest3269.name=Chickenization
gtnh.quest3269.desc=The soarleander generates mana by consuming anything chicken-related, including entire chickens.

# Quest.3270 - According to all known laws of mana generation...
gtnh.quest3270.name=According to all known laws of mana generation...
gtnh.quest3270.desc=...there is no way a bee should be able to produce mana. The beegonia doesn't know this, and will gladly eat up all of your spare drones to help with filling your mana pools.
